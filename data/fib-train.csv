If any of this sounds familiar, there is a chance you could be spending too much time on social networks.
An exclusive online Newsbeat poll suggests that a quarter of 15 to 18-year-olds in the UK feel happier online than they do in real life.
Dr Radha from The Surgery on Radio 1 has dealt with patients who have displayed ""a lot of social anxiety"" because they are using social networks too much.
""Being online can provoke a sense of 'I'm not good enough, everyone else is having an amazing life',"" she explained.
""It doesn't give us a sense of reality and actually what you will find is most people are probably doing the same thing as you are.""
The survey, carried out last month, also suggests a third of 15 to 18-year-olds have met someone in person they originally met through social media.
Dr Radha has said it is important people carefully consider what information they share with the online community.
""What this survey showed is a lot of people go online alone,"" she said.
""In terms of our personal details and how we respond to messages from other people, we need to make sure we are looking after all of that safely.""
Dr Radha was concerned that some people feel safer dealing with people online, rather than in person.
""The more time we spend online, the less we are able to develop our social skills,"" she explained.
""When you are online you're not getting eye contact with people or perceiving how body language is changing, so as a result what people are saying can be misinterpreted.
""Physical contact, like a hug and a kiss, is really important. You don't get that kind of emotional confidence from being online.""
If your online activity is leaving you feeling anxious, Dr Radha has advised that you should ""slowly try to wean yourself off it"".
She said: ""If you are worrying, 'what's going on? What am I missing?' It's a sign that being online too much is quite bad for you.
""Give yourself some rules by saying, 'I'm only going to check things three times a day for this amount of time'.""

38018439,"Speaking on TV, Maria Zakharova said Jews had told her they donated both to Mr Trump and Hillary Clinton.
She joked that American Jews were the best guide to US politics.
The diplomat's remarks caused shock. Anti-US propagandists in the last century peddled an idea that rich New York Jews controlled US politics.
Ms Zakharova was speaking on a chat show on Russian state TV at the weekend but her comments drew more attention after being picked up by media outlets on Thursday.
She said she had visited New York with an official Russian delegation at the time of the last UN General Assembly, in September.
""I have a lot of friends and acquaintances there, of course I was interested to find out: how are the elections going, what are the American people's expectations?"" she said.
""If you want to know what will happen in America, who do you need to talk to? You have to talk to the Jews, of course. It goes without saying.""
At this, the TV studio audience applauded loudly.
""I went here and there among them, to chat,"" she continued.
Imitating a Jewish accent, Mrs Zakharova said Jewish people had told her: ""'Marochka, understand this - we'll donate to Clinton, of course. But we'll give the Republicans twice that amount.' Enough said! That settled it for me - the picture was clear.
""If you want to know the future, don't read the mainstream newspapers - our people in Brighton [Beach] will tell you everything.""
She was referring to a district of Brooklyn with a large diaspora of Jewish emigres from the former Soviet Union.
Russian opposition activist Roman Dobrokhotov wrote on Twitter (in Russian) that the spokeswoman had ""explained Trump's victory as a Jewish conspiracy"".
Michael McFaul, the former US ambassador to Moscow, commented on Facebook, ""Wow. And this is the woman who criticizes me for not being diplomatic.""
During the election campaign, Mrs Clinton accused Mr Trump of posting a ""blatantly anti-Semitic"" tweet after he used an image resembling the Star of David and stacks of money.
Mr Trump, whose son-in-law Jared Kushner is Jewish, dismissed the accusation as ""ridiculous"".

32790804,"A report by the organisation suggests men, women and children are being abused ""to eliminate public protest"".
Many are subjected to virginity tests, rape and gang rape after arrest.
Egypt's Interior Ministry said it would not comment until it had studied the report.
The study notes a surge in sexual violence after the Egyptian military takeover in July 2013.
The perpetrators are rarely held to account and the impunity points to a ""cynical political strategy aimed at silencing all opposition"".
Police, intelligence officers and members of the military are guilty of targeting male and female detainees, according to the report.
Among the victims are student demonstrators, human rights activists, gay people and children.

I saw an officer who was grabbing a young woman by the breasts and I said to him: ""If you want to arrest her, then arrest her, but you have no right to touch her breasts.""
He grabbed me exactly as he had her, before calling two other police officers to come and hold me. They beat me, insulted me.
In the van they insulted me and beat me so much that I could no longer stand up. Two soldiers started to sexually assault me.
The officer from the start got into the van and said to me: ""Come here I'm going to show you if I'm a man."" He sexually assaulted me, the soldiers laughed, and then he raped me completely. I was paralysed, I started to vomit blood.
My life is ruined. I'm afraid of my son, my husband and even my father.
The authors said they did not have evidence that commanders were giving the orders, but the scale of the violence - and the impunity - suggested there was a political strategy.
They claim that victims who file complaints are systematically obstructed by the justice system, and face threats and reprisals by police officers and prison guards.
Sexual violence has long been a problem within the general population in Egypt, with assaults dramatically increasing in the years since Hosni Mubarak was removed from power.
Last year, President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi ordered police to launch a crackdown amid growing public anger.
He said sexual assaults, were ""an unacceptable form of conduct"" and called for citizens to ""reinstate moral values in society"".","Egyptian security forces are using sexual violence against detainees on a massive scale, it is reported.","Egyptian police are systematically abusing detainees, including women, in a campaign to end impunity, the Human Rights Watch says.",1,bart-base,xsum,0

They face possible jail terms on charges including insulting civil servants and refusing to disperse.
Video of the protests showing people being cornered by police and beaten sparked international condemnation.
President Thein Sein of Myanmar (formerly Burma) has defended the action of officers, telling the BBC that in many Western countries a similar situation might have ended in gunfire and death.
In addition to the 65 people in court in the town of Letpadan on Wednesday, another five have been charged in absentia. Eleven people who were released on bail will be charged at a later date.
All could face jail terms of up to six years.
The BBC's Jonah Fisher, at the court, says relatives and supporters gathered outside the building with flowers, water and food for the detainees. Riot police were deployed to keep back the crowds.
Our correspondent says that while there have been reforms in Myanmar since the end of military rule, the case shows that its laws and legal system remain dated and repressive.
The students began a protest march from Mandalay to Yangon (also known as Rangoon) in January, in opposition to a bill which centralises control over higher education.
They were calling for more power to be devolved to universities and higher education institutions, the right to form student unions, and teaching in ethnic minority languages.
The march was technically illegal as it did not have official approval.  The two sides had been in negotiations, and the authorities had agreed to let the students continue to Yangon.
But the students were angered by police opposition when they reached Letpadan, 140km (90 miles) north of Yangon, and clashes broke out as they attempted to break through police lines.
Scores of students and some police officers were injured, while more than 100 people were arrested.

President Thein Sein of Myanmar (formerly Burma) has defended the action of officers, telling the BBC that in many Western countries a similar situation might have ended in gunfire and death.
In addition to the 65 people in court in the town of Letpadan on Wednesday, another five have been charged in absentia. Eleven people who were released on bail will be charged at a later date.
All could face jail terms of up to six years.
The BBC's Jonah Fisher, at the court, says relatives and supporters gathered outside the building with flowers, water and food for the detainees. Riot police were deployed to keep back the crowds.
Our correspondent says that while there have been reforms in Myanmar since the end of military rule, the case shows that its laws and legal system remain dated and repressive.
The students began a protest march from Mandalay to Yangon (also known as Rangoon) in January, in opposition to a bill which centralises control over higher education.
They were calling for more power to be devolved to universities and higher education institutions, the right to form student unions, and teaching in ethnic minority languages.
The march was technically illegal as it did not have official approval.  The two sides had been in negotiations, and the authorities had agreed to let the students continue to Yangon.
But the students were angered by police opposition when they reached Letpadan, 140km (90 miles) north of Yangon, and clashes broke out as they attempted to break through police lines.
Scores of students and some police officers were injured, while more than 100 people were arrested.
The government has announced an inquiry into the response of the security services, state media report. Young Burmese have been at the forefront of several protests in Myanmar over the years, including a notorious 1988 uprising against the former ruling junta.",Sixty-five people have appeared in court to be charged over a student protest that ended in violence.,More than 65 people have appeared in court in Myanmar charged with inciting violence and rioting.,0,bart-base,xsum,0
34563833,"Jones, 31, suffered a shin injury while on international duty with Trinidad and Tobago on Tuesday.
Cardiff manager Russell Slade said there was no break and Jones will be assessed once he returns to Wales.
""We're hoping he will be in on Sunday,"" said Slade. ""We don't know how long he'll be out for.""
This is the second time in the space of two months Jones has been unavailable for Cardiff following international duty.
He missed the opening four games of the season after being deemed unfit following his involvement in the Gold Cup, held in America and Canada in July.
The latest set-back came in his country's goalless draw with Nicaragua in Port of Spain when he was carried off on a stretcher after 73 minutes.
""It's not broken, that's the most important thing, but there is a lot of swelling there. It will be assessed the moment he lands,"" said Slade.
Jones' injury ends a miserable week for Slade that also saw him lose defender Bruno Ecuele Manga for at least two months to a groin injury sustained while training with Gabon.
""As with Bruno, it's difficult to get the information you require,"" added Slade of Jones' condition.
Cardiff missed the striker's presence on Saturday in a dour stalemate with Preston.
Slade admitted his side were poor as they registered two efforts on target against a team that started the afternoon on the bottom of the Championship table.
""I didn't think we got going until 50 or 60 minutes into the game and that can't happen,"" he said.
""Clearly it's not something we designed or wanted. We set out exactly what we wanted to do but we didn't do that.
""It can happen away from home sometimes, but it's dangerous because when you come up against top opposition, they will punish you in those periods.
""We haven't served up too many halves like that so benefit of the doubt.
""We came out for the second half and looked like a team again that wanted to go on and win a football match.""
Slade's mood on Saturday evening would not have been helped when one of his discarded strikers, Javi Guerra, put Rayo Vallecano in front against Barcelona in La Liga at the Nou Camp.

39066087,"sportscotland says it has yet to decide where the cuts will fall amid concerns that elite athletes could suffer.
The cuts are being blamed on reduced government spending and a drop in National Lottery ticket sales - a major contributor to sports backing.
Governing bodies are bracing themselves for potential job losses.
About 60% of funding is made up from Scottish Government money, with lottery sales making up the rest.
In the year ending 2015, total revenue was £65.1m, which is divided up and awarded to 52 sports.
By the end of next year, that figure will have fallen to £51.8m - a cut to the Scottish sporting budget of 20% in just three years.
sportscotland chairman Mel Young said: ""It's heartbreaking to me because I know the effort the sport governing bodies and the community that's around it; the volunteers and the mums and dads.
""And, to have to say that we're having to cut some money back is, I believe, not the right way to go.""
Former badminton player Susan Egelstaff, a double bronze medallist at the Commonwealth Games [in 2002 and 2006] and an Olympian, fears the cuts will have ""a huge impact"".
""What that means in the future is that Scotland will be constantly playing catch-up,"" she said. ""It's almost impossible to catch up if you fall too far behind the leading nations.""
The Scottish Government said sport and physical activity play a ""key role"" in a healthy Scotland and that ""significant"" investment would continue in those areas.
""Having successfully delivered the Commonwealth Games [in 2014] we are now focusing on protecting or raising investment in areas intended to decrease health inequality and improve life chances, and the small reduction in the sport budget allows us to support those priorities,"" Minister for Sport Aileen Campbell said.
""There is on-going support for active lifestyles through capital investment in cycling and walking, and over the last 10 years we have invested £168m in sport infrastructure - from grassroots to the elite performance which has increased the facilities and opportunities to get people active and achieve on the world stage at both the Olympics and Commonwealth Games.""","Sport funding in Scotland is facing a 20% reduction over a three-year period, a move described as ""heartbreaking"" by the sportscotland chairman.","Sport funding in Scotland is facing a 20% reduction over a three-year period, a move described as ""heartbreaking"" by the sportscotland chairman.",0,bart-base,xsum,1

34877526,"Published in The Times, the letter says fans are being ""ripped-off by touts who anonymously exploit fair ticket prices via online ticket marketplaces"".
It urges the government to put ""the public's interests before the touts"".
A government consultation on the resale of tickets closes on Friday.
""As artist managers, we deplore the increasing industrial-scale abuse and insider exploitation of tickets for music, arts and sports events by ticket touts,"" the letter says.
""The consequence in many cases is that fans will attend fewer shows, meaning that the profits made by such immoral practice is also money lost from the industry.""
It is signed by managers for the UK's biggest live acts including One Direction, Little Mix, Radiohead, Mumford and Sons, Iron Maiden, Arctic Monkeys and Noel Gallagher.
The letter agrees there is a need for ""genuine, transparent ticket resale/exchange"" through businesses selling tickets at face value, and urges the review to recommend ""all parties in a ticketing transaction should indentify themselves"".
Earlier this week concert promoter Harvey Goldsmith told the BBC the issue of secondary ticketing websites was ""a national disgrace"".
He told Radio 4's Front Row programme that tickets to U2's recent London shows were advertised for up to Â£3,300 on resale sites, despite a face value of Â£182.
""We're asking the government to pass a law which says you cannot sell a ticket for more than 10%  of its face value,"" Goldsmith told the BBC.
Consumer magazine Which? also called for a crack-down on ticket resale sites earlier this month, arguing consumers face a ""stitch-up"".

Supporters said it would help unemployed people who fear taking a job would lead to cuts in their benefits.

Under Universal Basic Income (UBI) everyone would receive the same sum of money regardless of whether they work or not.
There would be no requirements to show an individual is looking for a job either.
In Scotland the policy has support from across the political spectrum, with feasibility work under way ahead of possible pilot schemes in Glasgow and Fife.

However Prof Minford, who was an adviser to former prime minister Margaret Thatcher, told the programme: ""This is not a workable scheme because it's far too expensive.
""It creates a tremendous tax, a disincentive for the average person further up the income scale who's paying for it all.""
Mr Drakeford told the assembly earlier in January he found the idea of UBI ""attractive in the way that it can simplify and support people who currently have to rely on a very complex set of part-time work, part-time benefits and so on"".
But he added: ""The political world will face a job of convincing the public about the merits of the scheme.""
Asked if he was worried by Mr Drakeford's comments, Prof Minford replied: ""It's quite worrying for Wales.

Mr Bercow insisted that the appointment must have the confidence of MPs and ""paused"" the recruitment process before re-starting it.
As part of a modernisation of procedures, the current responsibilities of the Clerk will now be split, with a new post of Commons director-general taking over responsibility for the day-to-day commercial and administrative functions of the Commons.
Announcing Mr Natzler's appointment in the Commons, Mr Bercow said he had been chosen from a field of four candidates.
Welcoming the appointment, David Cameron joked that Mr Bercow had ""gone to the ends of the earth"" to find the most qualified candidate and he was ""very glad he found the right answer right here in Britain"".
Labour leader Ed Miliband said Mr Natzler's appointment was ""well deserved"".
Before Sir Robert's retirement, Mr Natzler served as Clerk Assistant for many years.","Natzler has been named as the next Clerk of the Commons, ending a controversial process which pitted Bercow against some MPs.","The new Clerk of the House of Commons, John Bercow, has been named by Speaker John Bercow.",0,bart-base,xsum,0
35333277,"The 28-year-old Erskine has agreed a pre-contract to sign for Thistle on a three-year deal in June.
Manager Alan Archibald expects to lose Bannigan in the summer.
""We were aware of him being out of contract in at the end of the season and Dundee United hadn't made a move on it,"" he said of Erskine.
""We have went through the right channels and have that in place and it's a good one to look forward to for next season.""
It will be Erskine's third spell with United's Scottish Premiership rivals.
He started his career at Firhill before moving to Tannadice in 2013, only to be loaned back later that season.
But he was a first-team regular with the Tangerines last season.
This term, he missed out during September, October and November through injury but returned to action in December.
Asked if Erskine could join Thistle during the January transfer window, Archibald told BBC Scotland: ""That's down to Dundee United.
""He's their player and we have to respect that and we've just put that in place for next season.""
Archibald laughed off newspaper headlines suggesting that he had threatened to resign should Bannigan be sold during January.
""It was tongue in cheek what I said in the papers,"" he said. ""But I would be devastated and we'll not let him go.
""It would need to be crazy money to let him go.
""It would not be worth it for us as he is a key player.
""If you let your key player go in January for what would not be a great amount of money would send out all the wrong signals.""
However, asked about reported interest by Aberdeen, Archibald said: ""It is just paper talk. There have been a few linked with him.

40719927,"Helmut Oberlander says he was forced to act as a translator for the squad and did not participate in atrocities.
He has fought three prior attempts by Canada to strip his citizenship and won.
His lawyer says Mr Oberlander will also fight this latest citizenship revocation, calling it ""persecution"".
A spokeswoman with Citizenship Canada said in a statement to the BBC that ""we don't take citizenship revocation lightly, but it is necessary in cases of fraud and serious misrepresentation"".
Canada says that when Mr Oberlander  applied for entry to Canada in 1954, he obtained his citizenship by knowingly concealing that he had been an auxiliary of the Einsatzkommando, a force that operated behind the German army's front line in the Eastern occupied territories.
The squad is responsible for killing more than two million people, many of them Jewish people.
""We are determined to deny safe haven in Canada to war criminals and persons believed to have committed or been complicit in war crimes, crimes against humanity, or genocide,"" said Citizenship Canada's Lisa Filipps.
Mr Oberlander has argued in court that he was conscripted, had no alternative than to work for the Germans, and would have been subject to the harshest penalties had he disobeyed.
Canada has revoked his citizenship three times since 1995.  Each time it was overturned on appeal.
In 2016, Canada's Supreme Court refused to hear the government's appeal of a lower court ruling that Ottawa should reconsider its decision to revoke Mr Oberlander's citizenship.
His lawyer Ronald Poulton says Canada ""appears prepared to hound Mr Oberlander and his family to his grave"".
""In order to find Mr. Oberlander complicit in war crimes, given his limited and forced participation with the German military, they had attempted to stretch fiction into fact and to rely on an outdated archaic principle known as guilt by association,"" he said.
Mr. Oberlander was born in Halbstadt, Ukraine in 1924, and he obtained his Canadian citizenship in 1960.
Shimon Koffler Fogel, with the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs, praised Canada for its ""tireless"" efforts to strip Mr Oberlander of his citizenship.
""This latest development is an important milestone in bringing a measure of justice to his many victims and their families,"" he said in a statement.

Stimpson made a strong start to the season, winning the opening World Series event in Abu Dhabi and the sprint distance World Cup in Australia.

Another bomber is said to have blown himself up among fleeing worshippers.
Meanwhile the death toll from Sunday's suicide bombing in Baghdad has again been raised, from 281 to 292.
Amid growing public anger over the truck bombing, Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi fired the three top security officials in Baghdad on Friday.
They were the head of Baghdad's security command, the head of interior ministry intelligence for Baghdad and the official responsible for Baghdad in the national security adviser's office.
IS said five of its members had carried out the raid on the site in Balad. The militant group follows an extreme form of Sunni Islam and often targets Shias, who it regards as apostates.
About 50 people were injured in the attack, police and medical sources said.

Worshippers were marking the Eid al-Fitr festival, celebrating the end of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, when the site came under mortar fire.
The first bomber then struck a market at the entrance to the shrine.
A third bomber was shot dead before he was able to detonate his explosive vest, reports say.
It came four days after IS carried out the deadliest bombing in Baghdad, 45 miles (70km) south of Balad, since the 2003 US-led invasion.

40705662,"She said she was ""so proud and excited"" about her new role, describing it as ""a dream come true"".
Terry, who has performed at the Globe in As You Like It, A Midsummer Night's Dream and Love's Labour's Lost, will take over from Emma Rice in April 2018.
Terry won an Olivier award for her performance in Tribes at the Royal Court in 2010.
She also wrote and starred in the Sky One series The Cafe, with Ralf Little.
Neil Constable, chief executive of Shakespeare's Globe, said: ""Audiences have loved her sparkling and intelligent performances on our stage over the years - now they will have the opportunity to see her fresh artistic vision come to life as she moves into a new phase of her impressive career.""
Terry most recently starred as the king in Henry V at Regent's Park Open Air Theatre, and as Grace in Katie Mitchell's production of Cleansed for the National Theatre.
The actor-manager is a role as old as the theatre itself, and is a tried and tested practice at the Globe - with Mark Rylance combining the roles with considerable success during his stint as its artistic director.
There is no obvious reason why an intelligent and versatile actress such as Michelle Terry, who is immersed in Shakespeare and the Globe, shouldn't make a success of it too.
This is as long as she is free to pursue her creative vision without unwelcome intrusion from a board who made a complete hash of the Rice era.
The news comes following the controversial announcement of Rice's departure. She is leaving after the Globe's board decided her methods were not authentic enough.
Rice took charge of the London theatre in January 2016 but has come in for fierce criticism, including for her use of sound and lighting technology.
Earlier this year Rice wrote an open letter to her successor, in which she claimed the board had sought to impose ""a new set of rules that I did not sign up to and could not stand by"".
Rice is now launching a new theatre company at London's Old Vic.
The Globe, which opened in 1997, is a reconstruction of a Shakespearean theatre on London's Southbank.

But Wood Green councillor Alan Strickland said: ""This is a piece of art given to the community for public enjoyment, and people will find it galling that you can only view this work at an expensive champagne reception, when it belongs with the people of north London, not a private owner.

The Akademi had been criticised for not speaking out against the attacks sooner, with over 40 writers returning their awards to protest the institution's ""silence"" on the ""attacks against dissent"".
Akademi president Vishwanath Prasad Tiwari had earlier called the protest ""illogical"", but accepted a memorandum on Friday from the writers, who held a silent march to the institution's headquarters.
The Akademi then later issued a statement condemning ""any atrocity against any writer anywhere in the country in the strongest of words"".
It also condemned the killing of rationalist Kalburgi ""and other intellectuals and thinkers"", and called on ""governments at the centre and in the states to take immediate action to bring the culprits to book and to ensure the security of writers now and in the future"".
Speaking to the BBC, Githa Hariharan of the Indian Cultural Forum, made up of a number of writers who returned their awards, said that the Akademi statement was welcome although ""late"".
However she said that the issues that had prompted the protests in the first place remained a matter of concern for writers.
""The silence of the Sahitya Akademi was a tipping point for the pain and anguish felt by many of us who are struggling to recognise the India we grew up in. It became a symbol for our frustrations. But now it's time to move on to to addressing these larger issues as well,"" she said.
The writers' protest was seen as unprecedented in India.
Some of the writers who returned their awards included two of India's most highly respected writers, Nayantara Sahgal, and Krishna Sobti. Other writers like Shashi Deshpande, K Satchidanandan and PK Parakkadavu also returned awards and resigned from the Akademi's councils.","Sahitya Akademi, which bestows awards, has condemned recent attacks on writers and rationalists.","Sahitya Akademi, which bestows awards, has condemned recent attacks on writers and rationalists.",0,bart-base,xsum,1

32963257,"It comes after Ruskin College's governing body agreed to cut two of its six BA programmes and one of its three MA courses to save money.
College principal Chris Wilkes said the decision was related to ""low student numbers rather than any other reason"".
He said it would continue to focus on adult education.
Famous Ruskin College alumni include former deputy prime minister John Prescott and Dennis Skinner, MP for Bolsover in Derbyshire.
BA English Studies, BA History with Social Sciences and MA Women's Studies are being discontinued.
Anne Hughes, 63, from Thame in Oxfordshire, has been studying BA English Studies part-time at the college for two years.
She said she was ""absolutely distraught"" it was being cut.
She is physically disabled and has depression, and said she chose to study at the college because it worked with ""disadvantaged, disabled and mature students"".
The college also offers bespoke timetables, unlike some other places of higher education, she added.
Online petitions have been set up in a bid to save the English faculty and the Women's Studies course.
One signatory, Jenny Lewis, wrote on the first petition: ""[Tutors] Helen Kidd and Tom Sherry are carrying on the great Ruskin tradition of bringing opportunities to those that otherwise would not have them.""
Student and activist Saskia Ritchie, who set up the second petition, said Ruskin had been set up for ""people who would traditionally be excluded from academia"" and gives ""access to truly excellent learning opportunities"".
Mr Wilkes said the college would lose about 25 students as a result of the cuts.
He added degrees had been on offer at the college for about 10 years and were ""relatively new"" considering the college's 116-year history.
""Our focus will continue to be on educating adults and I think what we're doing is just renewing our offer but doing it in a different way, fulfilling our mission in a different way, to perhaps how we've done it in the past,"" Mr Wilkes added.

Mr Webb and Miss Baughan were on a four-month trip when he injured his arm and knee in the fall on the 3,100m (10,300ft) high Fansipan mountain in the north of Vietnam.

""Aiden said a rock had cut his arm open and he had hurt his knee. We were in touch all night.

The expense met with anger in Israel, which is facing austerity measures.
Mr Netanyahu's office said the prime minister had been unaware of the cost.
Israeli media reports said the cost was incurred by having four walls and door installed around a double bed, and 22 business class seats fitted on a plane chartered from El Al, Israel's national airline.
The flight from Israel to the UK takes about five-and-a-half hours.
The aircraft cost about $300,000 to use, before the custom fittings. Israel's Channel 10 first reported the story, which triggered angry reactions in the media.
""Bibi is king, and in a monarchy, when the king and queen fly, price is no object,"" said political commentator Sima Kadmon, referring to Mr Netanyahu by his nickname, in Israel's biggest-selling newspaper Yediot Ahranot.
Mr Netanyahu's office said the prime minister needed a good night's sleep on the flight ahead of a day of busy schedules. It later said the prime minister had not been aware of the additional cost and had ordered cut-backs.
Reports said customised ""rest chambers"" would no longer be used on European flights, while other media quoted his office as saying they would be dropped all together.
The news came at a time when Israelis face tax rises as part of austerity measures being discussed by the cabinet.
It also follows the revelation earlier this year that the prime minister's office had an annual budget of $2,700 for ice-cream bought by his staff from a Jerusalem shop.

Council officials held talks with 30 organisations to develop a plan to eliminate rough sleeping by June 2017.
Lithuanian Kristians Olsteins has been rough sleeping in Northampton for about four months after losing his job and passport.
He said it was not a lifestyle choice for him and he would like nothing more than to have a home.
Mike Hallet, who has been homeless for two years, also denied it was a choice.
He said: ""Of course, I would like to be off the streets - it is horrible and I would rather be anywhere else.""
But Darren Jordan, who lived on the streets for two months before finding space in a homeless shelter, believes ""some people get stuck in a rut and then it does become a lifestyle choice"".
Northampton Hope Centre runs a day centre supporting people who are homeless or in poverty and was one of the organisations consulted by council officials.
General manager Robin Burgess said: ""It's clear there are people who have become accustomed to life on the street over many years - or even decades.
""Some are European and some are addicted to drink and alcohol - but I don't believe anyone actively chooses to sleep on the streets.""
He said the way to address homelessness is to supply individual support for as long as is needed.
Under a three-year plan set to be discussed on Wednesday, it is proposed that Northampton Borough Council will provide a temporary night shelter which would require some initial set-up costs ""likely to be under Â£50,000"".
The financial implications of setting up and running the shelter for up to 18 months will be fully-costed and any plan will require approval.
""Comprehensive support plans"" for ""rough sleepers with complex needs"" would also be introduced.
Crisis, a charity for single homeless people, said rough sleeping was ""incredibly dangerous"" and a homeless person was ""13 times more likely to be a victim of violence than the average member of the public"".

34017556,"Citizens Advice Scotland said the number of employment cases it had seen had risen by 12% in the last four years and was  now at its highest level.
It said the most common issues involved low pay, withheld wages and unfair dismissal, as well as bullying and discrimination.
CAS has highlighted the issues in a report to MSPs.
Holyrood's Economy, Energy and Tourism committee is exploring how employment and job quality has changed since the 2008 recession.
CAS said it had gathered evidence showing workplace problems were growing in Scotland.
Staff across its 61 sites reported that they were increasingly advising clients who were in work but struggling to pay for essentials.
Delivering the report to the Scottish Parliament, the charity's spokesman Rob Gowans said:  ""What our report shows is the collected evidence of all the work-related cases that people have brought to the Scottish CAB (Citizen Advice Bureaux) service over the last few years.
""While we don't give away the identities of any of our clients, our evidence shows real-life experience. There is a growing crisis of low pay and poor conditions in Scotland.
""Around half of Scots who are in poverty are actually working. This reflects the fact that the minimum wage is not in fact keeping up with inflation, and many of the benefits that are meant to supplement low wages are being cut.

Mr Gowans also raised concerns about ""too many rogue employers"" who were ""exploiting"" workers under this environment.
""The growth in zero hours contracts has become a huge problem, which leaves thousands of Scots in huge financial uncertainty. And meanwhile it is becoming harder than ever to challenge unfair treatment,"" he added.

34017556,"Citizens Advice Scotland said the number of employment cases it had seen had risen by 12% in the last four years and was  now at its highest level.
It said the most common issues involved low pay, withheld wages and unfair dismissal, as well as bullying and discrimination.
CAS has highlighted the issues in a report to MSPs.
Holyrood's Economy, Energy and Tourism committee is exploring how employment and job quality has changed since the 2008 recession.
CAS said it had gathered evidence showing workplace problems were growing in Scotland.
Staff across its 61 sites reported that they were increasingly advising clients who were in work but struggling to pay for essentials.
Delivering the report to the Scottish Parliament, the charity's spokesman Rob Gowans said:  ""What our report shows is the collected evidence of all the work-related cases that people have brought to the Scottish CAB (Citizen Advice Bureaux) service over the last few years.
""While we don't give away the identities of any of our clients, our evidence shows real-life experience. There is a growing crisis of low pay and poor conditions in Scotland.
""Around half of Scots who are in poverty are actually working. This reflects the fact that the minimum wage is not in fact keeping up with inflation, and many of the benefits that are meant to supplement low wages are being cut.
He added: ""With wages falling in real terms, families are becoming trapped in poverty, less secure terms and working hours, and with basic employment rights becoming harder to enforce.""

35805844,"Six authorities have told BBC Wales a meltdown in waste markets has hit their budgets.
Pembrokeshire council has seen the price it gets for steel drop by 88% over the year - while Flintshire has seen the price for plastics halved.
Experts say a slump in oil prices, cheap steel imports, and China's economic slowdown are to blame.
""We try to play the markets as best we can,"" Harvey Mitchell, the waste services manager for Flintshire, said.
""It makes it difficult when we do have a drop in issues we can't control, such as the global price of oil, or when larger countries flood the European market with steel.""
Flintshire has been celebrating a record year for recycling household waste - up to 58% of everything thrown away now ends up at its waste recover facility in Buckley.
""But while we've seen an increase in the amount of material we've collected, we've actually seen a drop in the income because of the market prices,"" Mr Mitchell said.
Recycled waste netted the council £537,000 in revenue in 2015/16, but this represented a drop of 45% in the expected income - more than £400,000 in lost cash.
The pattern has been repeated in Pembrokeshire, where £360,000 has been wiped off the council's expected income, while four other councils saw a combined drop of £335,000.
""This is an issue which is impacting upon Wales as a whole, not just Pembrokeshire,"" a council official there said.
""Fortunately quotes for the coming months are starting to look more positive with prices starting to increase.""
The impact on most of the other Welsh councils which responded to BBC Wales has been minimal, as they said are tied into long term contracts dealing with their recycling services.
But one academic expert said authorities and the public in Wales will need to refocus as they face ever increasing targets on recycling.
By 2025 Welsh authorities are being asked to recycle 70% of waste - by 2050, it should be 100%.
""Waste prevention is what this is all about,"" Rebecca Colley-Jones, from Bangor University's Sustainability Lab, said.
""It's about buying smartly, being able to think about what you do with it so it can be reused, because reuse is a form of waste prevention.

The club regretted a former employee had been remiss in their duties.
In a statement, the family of Mr Hamed, who is now 27, said they were ""relieved"" a settlement had been reached, following a decade-long legal battle .

""We risked losing our home and faced personal financial ruin in order to pursue justice for our son.

The teenager collapsed during the game against Cercle Bruges on 4 August 2006 and was rushed to an intensive care unit but suffered oxygen starvation to his brain.

Football Association rules require all football academy recruits to be referred to a cardiologist to help identify those prone to potentially fatal heart conditions.
Mr Hamed's MRI scan showed no obvious signs of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, but Dr Mills wrote to Spurs saying the condition could not be excluded on these findings alone.
Eleven months later, the teenager, who was unaware his tests had revealed an ""abnormal"" heart condition, signed a contract with Spurs.

37541121,"Radwan Hamed collapsed during a game in Belgium in 2006. Last year a judge ruled Spurs breached its duties to him.
In a screening prior to signing for the club, an electrocardiogram test showed his heart was ""unequivocally abnormal"" but he was not stopped from playing.
The club regretted a former employee had been remiss in their duties.
In a statement, the family of Mr Hamed, who is now 27, said they were ""relieved"" a settlement had been reached, following a decade-long legal battle .
""Just as Radwan had no choice but to start his difficult journey towards recovery, we had no choice but to start the difficult journey to obtain justice,"" they said.
""We risked losing our home and faced personal financial ruin in order to pursue justice for our son.
""The club did not tell us or Radwan about his potentially fatal condition. Had they done so, Radwan would not have continued to play football.""
The teenager collapsed during the game against Cercle Bruges on 4 August 2006 and was rushed to an intensive care unit but suffered oxygen starvation to his brain.

Llanberis Mountain Rescue said many of those tackling the peak were unprepared in terms of knowledge and equipment, with many needing assistance.
Chairman of the team of volunteers, Rob Johnson, said ""serious consideration"" needed to be given to how the 3,560 ft (1,085m) peak was managed.

He said many of the callouts were preventable and, with the right knowledge and equipment, they could have been avoided.

35907701,"SSAFA said there were more than 3,000 calls to Forcesline from serving troops last year, up from 1,600 in 2014.
The service was set up at the Army's request after four recruits died at its Deepcut Barracks in Surrey.
SSAFA said the rise in the number of calls ""although not a cause for panic, is reason for concern"".
The charity's chief executive, Air Vice Marshal David Murray, said: ""Those who serve in our armed forces are by their very nature resilient characters. They are then trained to be the most robust versions of themselves, so for some asking for help can be a real challenge.
""It is interesting that the service men and women who are contacting us are choosing to come to SSAFA, rather than their own chain of command, as the 'grin and bear it' attitude within the serving community remains strong.""
He said it was ""imperative"" that the welfare of service personnel welfare remained a priority and troops did not feel they had to ""deal with their issues on their own"".
""They have been there when our country has needed them and we must be there when they need us,"" he said.
A Ministry of Defence spokesman said: ""The government is absolutely committed to the wellbeing of our armed forces and provides a wide range of support both during and after service.
""We enshrined the armed forces covenant in law and have introduced a raft of measures designed to improve service life.
""The government works in close partnership with the service charitable sector on these issues and we value contributions such as this.""
SSAFA, formerly known as the Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Families Association, has a network of 7,000 volunteers providing support for serving personnel as well as veterans.
Between 1995 and 2002, four Army recruits died from gunshot wounds in unexplained circumstances at Deepcut, sparking allegations of bullying and abuse.
The Army said all of the deaths were suicides but, in each case, the families disagreed.
A second inquest is taking place into the death of one of those recruits, Private Cheryl James, more than 20 years after her death.
Among other things, the coroner will consider accusations that there were ""shortcomings"" with barracks policies on sexual behaviour, supervision of young women, drugs, alcohol and accommodation.
In total, the SSAFA helpline received 21,983 requests for help in 2015, up 6% on the year before.","A helpline has seen a nearly 90% increase in requests for help from serving military personnel, an armed forces charity has said.","The number of calls to the Armed Forces Support Agency (SSAFA) has risen by more than a third in a year, the charity has said.",1,bart-base,xsum,0

The service was set up at the Army's request after four recruits died at its Deepcut Barracks in Surrey.
SSAFA said the rise in the number of calls ""although not a cause for panic, is reason for concern"".
The charity's chief executive, Air Vice Marshal David Murray, said: ""Those who serve in our armed forces are by their very nature resilient characters. They are then trained to be the most robust versions of themselves, so for some asking for help can be a real challenge.
""It is interesting that the service men and women who are contacting us are choosing to come to SSAFA, rather than their own chain of command, as the 'grin and bear it' attitude within the serving community remains strong.""
He said it was ""imperative"" that the welfare of service personnel welfare remained a priority and troops did not feel they had to ""deal with their issues on their own"".
""They have been there when our country has needed them and we must be there when they need us,"" he said.
A Ministry of Defence spokesman said: ""The government is absolutely committed to the wellbeing of our armed forces and provides a wide range of support both during and after service.
""We enshrined the armed forces covenant in law and have introduced a raft of measures designed to improve service life.
""The government works in close partnership with the service charitable sector on these issues and we value contributions such as this.""
SSAFA, formerly known as the Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Families Association, has a network of 7,000 volunteers providing support for serving personnel as well as veterans.
Between 1995 and 2002, four Army recruits died from gunshot wounds in unexplained circumstances at Deepcut, sparking allegations of bullying and abuse.
The Army said all of the deaths were suicides but, in each case, the families disagreed.
A second inquest is taking place into the death of one of those recruits, Private Cheryl James, more than 20 years after her death.
Among other things, the coroner will consider accusations that there were ""shortcomings"" with barracks policies on sexual behaviour, supervision of young women, drugs, alcohol and accommodation.

The ministry of tourism could also insist that all climbers have previous mountaineering experience.
Nepal makes millions of dollars every year from the Everest industry but has been criticised for poor management.
In 2014, the mountain was closed after 16 Sherpas (guides) died in an accident.
And earlier this year, the climbing season was called off after a massive earthquake triggered an avalanche that killed 18 climbers.
Over the past decade many people have sought to establish world records on the world's highest mountain, a practice the government wants to discourage.
The youngest person to climb Mount Everest was 13 and the oldest 80.
""We don't think we should issue permits to people who cannot see or walk or who don't have arms,"" tourism department chief Govinda Karki told AFP news agency.
""Climbing Everest is not a joke... it is not a matter of discrimination. How can you climb without legs? Someone will have to carry you up. We want to make the mountains safer for everyone, so we have to insist on some rules.""
Mr Karki also said the government was considering only issuing permits to climbers who have already scaled another mountain above 6,500m (21,300ft).
Over the years, Everest has attracted many climbers aiming to overcome their disabilities.
Last week, Japanese mountaineer Nobukazu Kuriki, who had previously lost nine fingers to frostbite, abandoned his attempt to climb the mountain.

Ms Tibaijuka, a former UN official, denies any wrongdoing.
She is a high-profile casualty in a corruption scandal that has rocked Tanzania's government and energy firms, straining relations with donors.
On 17 December, Attorney-General Frederick Werema resigned after MPs accused him of authorising the fraudulent transfer of about $120m to an energy firm.
He denied the allegation, but said he was stepping down because the controversy had ""disrupted the country's political atmosphere"".
Mr Kikwete, in a televised address, said the government was still investigating allegations of impropriety against Energy and Minerals Minister Sospeter Muhongo and his permanent secretary Eliakim Maswi.

However, Mr  Kikwete said he had dismissed her because ""one of the biggest questions raised is why this money was not paid directly to the school and was instead deposited in a personal bank account in her name,"" Reuters news agency quotes him as saying.

Tanzania's parliament, which is dominated by the ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) party, has been putting pressure on Mr Kikwete to sack top officials accused of siphoning government money in collusion with businessmen linked to the energy sector.
An investigation by a parliamentary watchdog committee found that about $120m had been taken from an escrow account, paid to an energy firm and then given to various government ministers.

37276218,"Carbon is the key ingredient for all life on our planet.
But how Earth acquired its ""volatile elements"" - which have low boiling points - such as carbon and sulphur remains a subject of some debate.
A team now argues that a collision between Earth and an embryonic planet like Mercury could provide the answer.
Details of the work appear in the journal Nature Geoscience.
""The challenge is to explain the origin of the volatile elements like carbon that remain outside the core in the mantle portion of our planet,"" said Rajdeep Dasgupta, a co-author of the study from Rice University in Houston, Texas.
According to a widely accepted idea called the Late Veneer Hypothesis, Earth formed from material that was largely devoid of volatiles. These elements, such as carbon, sulphur, nitrogen and hydrogen, were added later on by space rocks after Earth's core had finished forming.
""Any of those elements that fell to Earth in meteorites and comets more than about 100 million years after the Solar System formed could have avoided the intense heat of the magma ocean that covered Earth up to that point,"" said Yuan Li, from the Guangzhou Institute of Geochemistry at the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
""The problem with that idea is that while it can account for the abundance of many of these elements, there are no known meteorites that would produce the ratio of volatile elements in the silicate portion of our planet.""
The group had previously published papers showing that if even if carbon had not vaporised into space when the planet was largely molten, it would have ended up in the metallic core of our planet - because the iron-rich alloys there have a strong affinity for carbon.
But if this is the case, where did the carbon in the mantle and biosphere come from?
The team used laboratory experiments that can recreate the high-pressure and high-temperature conditions that exist deep inside Earth and other rocky planets.
The found that one scenario that could reconcile the discrepancies in the carbon-to-sulphur ratio and carbon abundance was an embryonic planet like Mercury colliding with and being absorbed by Earth, early in its history.
""Because it's a massive body, the dynamics could work in a way that the core of that planet would go directly to the core of our planet, and the carbon-rich mantle would mix with Earth's mantle,"" said Dr Dasgupta.","Much of Earth's life-giving carbon could have been delivered in a planetary collision, a theory suggests.",Scientists have identified a new answer to the mystery of how Earth formed.,1,bart-base,xsum,0

36206936,"The specialist, Dr Howard Kornfeld, was unable to make it from California to Minnesota immediately but sent his son.
In a strange turn of events, it was his son, Andrew Kornfeld, who called police after joining Prince's staff to search for the missing singer.
The Kornfelds' lawyer said neither had met Prince before his death.
William Mauzy told reporters on Wednesday that Prince's team contacted Dr Howard Kornfeld on 20 April, the day before Prince died.
Unable to make it to Minnesota, the doctor dispatched his son and called a local doctor, who cleared his morning schedule but never saw the singer.
When Andrew Kornfeld, who works with his father but is not a doctor, arrived at Prince's Paisley Park home, he was told that the singer was missing. He joined members of staff to search the property and made the emergency call when Prince's unresponsive body was found.
Mr Mauzy said the plan was to stabilise him in Minnesota, before flying him to California to seek treatment at Dr Kornfeld's Recovery Without Walls rehab centre in Mill Valley.
The lawyer confirmed that Andrew Kornfeld had been interviewed by police, but was protected by Minnesota's Good Samaritan law. The law offers some legal protections to those who make emergency calls, to encourage them to do so.
No details have been released from Prince's autopsy exam, but investigators are looking into whether he died from an overdose and if a doctor was prescribing him drugs in the weeks before his death.
They are also trying to establish whether a doctor was on the singer's plane when it made an emergency landing less than a week before he died.
The musician was found unconscious on the plane after it stopped in Moline, Illinois, on 15 April. Detectives investigating his death have asked to see fire and ambulance records related to the emergency landing.
It emerged on Wednesday that emergency calls were made from the Paisley Park complex 46 times in the past five years.
A log released by Minnesota authorities showed the 911 calls related to everything from medical emergencies to false fire alarms.
It included one call in 2011 in which an unidentified woman said she was concerned about Prince's cocaine use, but no police action was taken.","Prince's team requested a specialist just a day before the singer died, the doctor's lawyer has revealed.","Prince's team requested a specialist just a day before the singer died, the doctor's lawyer has revealed.",0,bart-base,xsum,1
36206936,"The specialist, Dr Howard Kornfeld, was unable to make it from California to Minnesota immediately but sent his son.
In a strange turn of events, it was his son, Andrew Kornfeld, who called police after joining Prince's staff to search for the missing singer.
The Kornfelds' lawyer said neither had met Prince before his death.
William Mauzy told reporters on Wednesday that Prince's team contacted Dr Howard Kornfeld on 20 April, the day before Prince died.
Unable to make it to Minnesota, the doctor dispatched his son and called a local doctor, who cleared his morning schedule but never saw the singer.
When Andrew Kornfeld, who works with his father but is not a doctor, arrived at Prince's Paisley Park home, he was told that the singer was missing. He joined members of staff to search the property and made the emergency call when Prince's unresponsive body was found.
Mr Mauzy said the plan was to stabilise him in Minnesota, before flying him to California to seek treatment at Dr Kornfeld's Recovery Without Walls rehab centre in Mill Valley.
The lawyer confirmed that Andrew Kornfeld had been interviewed by police, but was protected by Minnesota's Good Samaritan law. The law offers some legal protections to those who make emergency calls, to encourage them to do so.
No details have been released from Prince's autopsy exam, but investigators are looking into whether he died from an overdose and if a doctor was prescribing him drugs in the weeks before his death.

40616502,"The UN estimates that a third more cocaine was being produced in the country in 2016.
The head of the UN Office on Drugs and Crime, Bo Mathiasen, called the increase significant.
Analysts say much of it was due to the end of the eradication of coca crops by spraying.
The report said the total coca-growing area rose from 96,000 hectares in 2015 to 146,000 in 2016.
Mr Mathiasen said that he held out hope for a reduction in cultivation because Colombia had signed a peace agreement with the biggest rebel group in the country, the Farc, which controlled much of the drug-producing areas.
But local analysts argue that the rise was caused partly by a hiatus resulting from the government's  peace deal with Farc rebels.
Under the deal, the Farc agreed to relinquish control over drug production areas and help the government try to encourage local farmers to plant substitute crops.
Farmers have taken advantage of the delays while the crop substitution policy is set up to plant coca, which has increased in price by almost 50%, because they know they will be offered subsidies later not to grow the plant.

Public Health Wales (PHW) said the main reason for the increase was an ageing population.
The organisation's Dr Dyfed Wyn Huws said there was ""good news"" by way of significant reductions in smoking rates in recent decades.
There was a year-on-year decrease from about 19,800 cases in 2014, but the 2015 figure of 19,088 is likely to increase as statisticians revise the numbers.
Once age factors are taken into account, the rate decreased by more than 5% in men, but increased by more than 5% among women between 2006 and 2015.
This is partly due to the rate of lung cancer going down in men, but up among women. Historically, smoking rates peaked far earlier among men than women.
Breast, prostate, lung and bowel cancers remain the most common.

A statement on Keighley's website said: ""The players' allocation of 'family and friends' tickets was then claimed to have been used to admit the playing squad and coaching staff into the ground.
""The club is outraged by this development.""
The BBC contacted Fryston Warriors, who have declined to comment at this time.","Keighley complained to RFL and collected amateur video footage of the brawl during a game against Fryston, which left a person with a broken jaw.","Keighley complained to RFL and collected amateur video footage of the brawl during a game against Fryston, which left a person with a broken jaw.",1,bart-base,xsum,1

Whitestone awarded Gillingham a penalty in first-half stoppage time before sending off Southend's Ryan Inniss for two bookable offences.
""There were four or five decisions that says that referee shouldn't be refereeing at this level,"" said Brown.
The 57-year-old claimed Whitestone did not cope with the pressure of the game between two sides separated by the mouth of the Thames.
""The referee mentioned to me that it was a derby game and he'd heard about the potential friction - but you can't take that into consideration,"" said Brown.
""He initially crossed his arms about to wave away the penalty but the next movement he blows for a foul. That, for me, is a referee under pressure.
""The sending off is even worse - unbelievable refereeing. This was officiating at its worst and someone has to be brought to task. I'm appealing the red card and if I can take it further than that I will.""

However, the Times of India reported that the incident happened when the jeep broke down and overturned as pilgrims tried to move it.
It crushed a number of people and caused others to stumble, which then triggered the stampede, the report said.

How President Zuma's Nkandla home has grown
The refurbishment of the residence in the village of Nkandla, in Mr Zuma's home province of KwaZulu-Natal, has turned into a major political controversy in South Africa.
Some of of the money was spent on building an amphitheatre, swimming pool, and cattle enclosure.
The opposition Democratic Alliance (DA) and Julius Malema's Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), who have called for a corruption investigation, say they are pressing ahead with their court case regardless of the president's latest offer.
Following Mr Zuma's announcement #PayBackThemoney is trending in South Africa - this was the phrase EFF MPs chanted at the president in parliament last year.
Many commentators seem sceptical.
Analysis: Milton Nkosi, BBC News
President Jacob Zuma's delayed willingness to pay back the money spent on the upgrades to his Nkandla residence could be a calculated move to avoid embarrassment at the Constitutional Court hearing expected next week.
But it could also be linked to the forthcoming local government election.
The Nkandla scandal has been a sore point for the governing African National Congress (ANC) which President Zuma leads, especially as the party faithful go out to campaign for votes.
Political analyst Professor Somadoda Fikeni told me that it could also be related to the president being ""politically vulnerable as he enters his 'lame-duck' period and following his mis-appointment of finance ministers"" at the end of last year.
Another consideration could well be an attempt to avert another episode of the chaotic scenes we saw during the opening of parliament last year when Julius Malema's Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) heckled and disrupted the president's state of the nation address.
Security personnel had to be called into the chamber to remove the MPs who would not stop shouting ""pay back the money'"" while President Zuma desperately tried to deliver his speech.

The Championship side but have struggled to pay players' wages since previously avoiding liquidation in April, and Rowland Phillips has not been replaced since leaving as head coach.
Welsh - one of England's oldest clubs, having been formed in 1885 - said the financial security provided by the unnamed California-based group would allow the club ""to plan for the future with confidence and renewed enthusiasm"".
Club chairman Bleddyn Phillips commented: ""We are thrilled and very excited to be able to announce the arrival of a new owner which will provide the club with the financial strength to sustain its ambition to be not only a competitive rugby team playing in the top tiers of the game in the United Kingdom, but, equally importantly, to consolidate and enhance its social, community and amateur based activities at its spiritual home at Old Deer Park"".
The Exiles were a Premiership side as recently as 2015, when they were based at the Kassam Stadium in Oxford and finished bottom of the table after losing all 22 games.
They subsequently returned to their traditional home at Old Deer Park in Richmond after three seasons away and started the new season with a narrow 33-32 defeat at Rotherham on Sunday.
Their plight further highlights the difficult financial situation in English rugby's second tier.
The Rugby Football Union, which runs the Championship, has been accused of under-funding the league, which was reduced from 16 teams to 12 in 2009.
Every team became fully professional at that time, and a new five-year funding deal with the governing body was agreed in 2015.

They subsequently returned to their traditional home at Old Deer Park in Richmond after three seasons away and started the new season with a narrow 33-32 defeat at Rotherham on Sunday.
Their plight further highlights the difficult financial situation in English rugby's second tier.
The Rugby Football Union, which runs the Championship, has been accused of under-funding the league, which was reduced from 16 teams to 12 in 2009.
Every team became fully professional at that time, and a new five-year funding deal with the governing body was agreed in 2015.

Inspectors also said pupil attainment was too low and a disadvantaged pupils' fund was not being used effectively.
Oxfordshire County Council said it will begin consulting on Friday over whether the school should shut.
The school, which educates children between 11 and 16 years old, received a good rating from Ofsted in 2012.
But after the most recent inspection, the watchdog said the school had shown a lack of management and effective teaching, which led to pupils underperforming.
It added: ""Standards in reading are too low. Pupils do not read well or widely enough.
""This restricts their access to the wider curriculum.""
The council will discuss the potential closure of the 500-pupil school with parents on 3 May.
A spokesman said the consultation - which will run until 16 June - will explore the potential impacts of the closure and how it can provide good-quality education to pupils.
Director of children's services Lucy Butler, said: ""It's important to stress at this stage that no decisions have been taken and that the school would not close without appropriate transfer arrangements in place for every child to attend a better-performing school.""

14370062,"Staff in Jobcentres, banks, building societies and utility companies in England could also be trained to spot - and counsel - vulnerable people.
The ideas are raised in a consultation paper on suicide prevention.
The Samaritans said councils should have a mandatory responsibility to try to prevent suicides in their areas.
Some 4,400 people killed themselves in England in 2009.
Claire Wylie, head of policy and research at the Samaritans, told the BBC News website that many suicide attempts were made on impulse, so trying to restrict access to potentially lethal means was important.
""We know that people who are feeling suicidal are often very ambivalent about actually ending their lives,"" she said.
""If you can interrupt them at that moment you can prevent them going ahead.""
Preventing deaths by jumping is a key aim of the consultation and it suggests a number of ways of doing that.
They include:
Overall, the number of suicides has steadily fallen in recent years, but the number of deaths on Britain's rail network had been rising until last year.
However, specialist training from Samaritans for rail staff was key to an 11% fall in 2010, according to the Rail Safety and Standards Board.
London Underground is also rolling out training to all of its staff after a pilot project at one station close to a psychiatric inpatient unit helped reduce suicides.
The government wants to see that sort of training given to a much wider range of people who come into contact with individuals who could be vulnerable because of their social or economic circumstances.
Jobcentre and benefit office staff, as well as employees in banks, building societies and utility firms are among those suggested in the consultation.
Ms Wylie said: ""More training for all frontline staff is really important, but that needs investment and money is tight.
""In general, we really welcome the government's strategy, but there needs to be a lot more actual commitment to action.
""There's also an issue about local implementation because things like putting up signs and barriers depend on the individual local authority actually caring about suicide prevention.

The Duchess of Cambridge joined the princes on the garden tour.

They met representatives from the causes and charities supported by Diana, including the Royal Marsden and Great Ormond Street hospitals, the National Aids Trust, Centrepoint youth homelessness charity and the Leprosy Mission.
Members of the public have been leaving tributes and flowers at the gates of the palace to mark the anniversary of Diana's death.
The Princess of Wales died on 31 August 1997 in Paris, when William, now the Duke of Cambridge, was 15 and his brother was 12.
The garden at their mother's former home has been inspired by memories of her life, style and image, such as her white ""Elvis"" Catherine Walker dress.
The White Garden, as it is known, follows a tradition first established at Sissinghurst Castle in Kent, famous for its own white garden created in the 1930s.
Their Royal Highnesses met gardener Sean Harkin who designed the display and Graham Dillamore who knew the princess when he worked there some 30 years ago.
The garden has been open since spring and will continue into September with white roses, lilies, gladioli and cosmos.
It is the fourth London memorial created in tribute to Diana - the others are the Diana Memorial Playground at Kensington Palace, the Diana Memorial Fountain in Hyde Park, and the Diana Memorial Walk at St James's Palace.",Prince William and his brother have visited a London memorial garden for their mother on the eve of the 20th anniversary of her death.,Prince William and his brother have visited a London memorial garden for their mother on the eve of the 20th anniversary of her death.,0,bart-base,xsum,1

Members of the public have been leaving tributes and flowers at the gates of the palace to mark the anniversary of Diana's death.
The Princess of Wales died on 31 August 1997 in Paris, when William, now the Duke of Cambridge, was 15 and his brother was 12.
The garden at their mother's former home has been inspired by memories of her life, style and image, such as her white ""Elvis"" Catherine Walker dress.
The White Garden, as it is known, follows a tradition first established at Sissinghurst Castle in Kent, famous for its own white garden created in the 1930s.
Their Royal Highnesses met gardener Sean Harkin who designed the display and Graham Dillamore who knew the princess when he worked there some 30 years ago.
The garden has been open since spring and will continue into September with white roses, lilies, gladioli and cosmos.
It is the fourth London memorial created in tribute to Diana - the others are the Diana Memorial Playground at Kensington Palace, the Diana Memorial Fountain in Hyde Park, and the Diana Memorial Walk at St James's Palace.",Prince William and his brother have visited a London memorial garden for their mother on the eve of the 20th anniversary of her death.,Prince William and Prince Harry have visited a garden created in memory of Princess Diana.,0,bart-base,xsum,0

TfL said more police have been deployed in accident hotspots and it is focusing on motorcycle and scooter safety.
The figures were released as the London Assembly committee published its report â€˜Easy Rider: Improving motorcycle safety on London roadsâ€™.
Researchers spoke to 1,200 riders and found one in five had been involved in a collision and about 62% motorcyclists had been involved in a near-miss incident.

The report found the inconsistency over access to bus lanes causes ""unnecessary confusion"" as TfL allows motorcyclists to ride in bus lanes on the roads it manages, while many boroughs do not.
It also asked TfL to monitor the impact of dedicated Cycle Superhighways on the road space shared by other traffic.

""The target is to get a lot of playing time and help Kasimpasa achieve their objectives,"" he told BBC Sport.
""I've come to Turkey to reciprocate the club's determination to bring me here. I want to show the manager and the fans that they have made a good choice and I am completely focused on breaking into the squad and prove myself here.
""They have strong faith in my ability and I need to prove it. Last season was difficult because of injuries which affected me both at club and international level but I have put all that behind me.
""Kasimpasa approached Chelsea in a professional manner and the chance to test myself in a top league is very challenging.""

38561886,"Esteban Ruiz Santiago is accused of murdering five people at the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International airport on Friday.
During a 15-minute court appearance on Monday he was told by the judge that he may face the death penalty.
Santiago answered the judge's questions in a clear voice.
He spoke very little during the hearing and confirmed to the judge that he understood the criminal charges and that he is a US citizen.
When asked about his employment, he told the judge that he worked for the Signal 88 security firm in Anchorage, Alaska, for the last few years and that he currently has only $5 to $10 in his bank account.
Security was high outside the courtroom, with more than 25 armed police guarding the building.
Santiago wore a red jumpsuit and was shackled at the wrists, stomach and legs throughout the hearing.
Authorities say they have not ruled out terrorism as a motive, and that they are investigating whether mental illness may have played a role in the attack.
In November 2016, Santiago visited an FBI building in Anchorage to tell agents he was hearing voices and believed that US spies were trying to control his mind.
According to a criminal complaint, Santiago told investigators that he flew one-way from Alaska to Florida to carry out the attack.
Agents say he checked a handgun into his luggage.
He retrieved the gun from the baggage carousel, and loaded it in a bathroom before emerging and firing at random, investigators say.

40568607,"Chisako Kakehi was arrested in 2014 and went on trial in Kyoto late last month.
Her lawyers have pleaded not guilty on her behalf, and when her trial began she said only that she would ""leave everything"" to her defence team.
But in court, asked if she killed her husband, she said there was ""no mistake"", the Mainichi reported.
The 70-year-old said she committed the crime because her husband was not treating her well financially, and that she obtained the cyanide from a business associate.
""I wasn't given any money after I married him,"" the Japan Times quoted Ms Kakehi as telling the court on Monday. ""I have no intention of hiding the guilt. I will laugh it off and die if I am sentenced to death tomorrow.""
Prosecutors say Ms Kakehi targeted the men for their money and poisoned them all with cyanide.
The investigation began when Isao Kakehi, her fourth husband who she reportedly met via a match-making site, died on 28 December 2013, a month after they got married.
A post mortem examination subsequently found traces of cyanide in his body, and investigators then began examining the deaths of other men linked to the pensioner.
She is now on trial for murdering him and two other boyfriends, and the attempted murder and robbery of another boyfriend who later died of cancer.
The men were all aged between 70 and 80 when the alleged crimes took place between 2007-2013.
Ms Kakehi's three other husbands also all died, but she has not been charged in connection with their deaths.
Lawyers for Ms Kakehi say her testimony cannot be trusted, because she has mild dementia.
""Since she is suffering from dementia, she barely remembers things that happened recently let alone the incidents,"" her team was quoted as saying at the start of the trial, which is expected to continue until November.

The sergeant and a constable involved were acquitted along with four colleagues in a criminal trial in 2009.
The High Court ruled the two men were racially abused and awarded damages.
The Met's Deputy Assistant Commissioner Fiona Taylor said the officers' actions had let down the public and all of the force.
Officers from the Territorial Support Group stopped the teenagers in June 2007 because they claimed that some of the group had been mouthing obscenities and making gestures at them.
Omar Mohidin was held in a police van for about five minutes while officers arrested Basil Khan who was handcuffed, strip searched and held in police custody for almost 20 hours.
Mr Justice Gilbart said Mr Khan had been wrongfully arrested and he accepted PC Mark Jones, who has since left the force, had hit Mr Khan, grabbing him around the neck and making it difficult for him to breathe.
The judge awarded Mr Khan £11,900 in damages and said Sgt William Wilson had also struck Mr Khan.
The court ruled Mr Mohidin was also falsely imprisoned for a few minutes during which time he was subjected to ""racist humiliation"", but that his injury amounted at most to feeling upset for a few days.
He dismissed Mr Mohidin's claim that he had suffered acute stress disorder as a result of the police action and awarded him £2,500.

She has not commented publicly on the case.
A lawyer for Ms Engels told the BBC that they were planning to challenge the immunity decision in court.
Willie Spies said he would argue that the first lady should not have been given special treatment as she had been in South Africa on private business.
The South African government's decision came in a notice from International Relations Minister Maite Nkoana-Mashabane, published in the Government Gazette on Sunday.
""I hereby recognise the immunities and privileges of the First Lady of the Republic of Zimbabwe, Dr Grace Mugabe,"" she said.
On Saturday, Mrs Mugabe had been due to take part in the first ladies' programme at the Southern African Development Community heads of state summit in Pretoria, which Mr Mugabe, 93, was attending.
However, she failed to show up.
South African police had said they wanted to interview Mrs Mugabe and had set up a ""red alert"" at the borders to try to ensure she did not leave the country.
But Zimbabwe's ZBC state broadcaster reported that President Mugabe and his wife ""arrived on board an Air Zimbabwe flight early on Sunday morning"".
It showed pictures of her greeting officials at Harare airport.
Ms Engels' lawyers have said their client was offered money to drop the case but she refused.
She appeared at a press conference on Thursday with a large plaster on her forehead. She has alleged that Mrs Mugabe beat her with an extension cable at the hotel where the model was staying with Mrs Mugabe's two sons.

36522094,"The 39-year-old has passed the Premier League and Football League's fit and proper person test and will become chairman of the West Midlands side.
He succeeds American Randy Lerner, who bought Villa for £62.6m in 2006.
Villa were relegated from the Premier League for the first time last season, finishing bottom, and have since named Roberto di Matteo as manager.
Dr Xia spent six years at Harvard and Massachusetts Institute of Technology, including five months at Oxford University, before returning to China.
He made his fortune as the owner of Recon Group, a holding company that has the controlling interest in five publicly listed companies on the Hong Kong and Chinese stock exchanges, employing 35,000 people in 75 countries.
His takeover comprises a £52m purchase price and a £24m overdraft. In addition, he will contribute £60m in operating costs.
Dr Xia met the Football League's Shaun Harvey in London on Monday for formal confirmation he had passed the owners' and directors' test, after the Premier League had been satisfied in its investigations.
The new Villa vice-chairman is Chris Samuelson, an international financier who has been involved in a failed takeover at fellow Championship club Reading.
He also attempted to inject finances into Premier League Everton more than a decade ago.
The new chief executive is Keith Wyness, who filled the same role at Scottish Premiership club Aberdeen, then Everton.
Samuelson was instrumental in getting Dr Xia interested in the Villa project and introduced the new owner to Wyness.
Dr Xia is expected to inject about £30m into the transfer fund available to former Chelsea, West Brom and Schalke boss Di Matteo as he rebuilds a first-team squad that won only three league games last season.

Boylett was released on bail to be sentenced on 28 April.
Crystal Palace, who are nicknamed The Eagles, adopted Kayla as a mascot in 2010.
Who is Kayla the Eagle?
The court heard handler Chris Belsey was walking around the Selhurst Park pitch with the bird on his forearm at the game.
Prosecutor Daniel Higgins said ""three or four fans were shouting abuse"" at the pair when one leaned over the barrier and ""threw a punch"".
He said Mr Belsey did not know if the punch had landed and Kayla ""seemed unhurt"", but ""due to her delicate bone structure if she had been hit with force, her bones could easily break"".
Four other men were on trial with Boylett over the trouble which marred the Capital One third-round tie.
Mr Higgins said there had been trouble ""before, during and after"" the game.
The first scuffles broke out as police escorted Charlton supporters to Selhurst Park.
One officer suffered a cut lip after being hit by what he thought was a bottle as rival fans tried to break the police cordon, the court heard.
At the end of the match, which Charlton lost 4-1, Donegan ran at police wielding a large yellow cone and had to be ""subdued with a baton strike"".
After his arrest, he told police he was ""annoyed"" as ""we just got battered. I picked it up and let my anger out"".

In January the group revealed plans to cut editorial jobs across its operations in the UK, as part of a drive to cut costs following a decline in revenue.

The company stated that this year it would ""focus on and invest in our primary brands, operating in growth markets with attractive audiences"".
Johnston added: ""We have identified a number of newsbrands that are now considered non-core and such will be either divested or run with less costs, reflecting the medium-term outlook for the identified assets that fall into this category.

35870417,"The Edinburgh-based group said profit increased by 22.6% to £31.5m, while revenues were down 6.8%, to £242.3m.
However, total operating costs were cut by 6.7% to £191.7m.
The figures were released as Johnston confirmed that shareholders had overwhelmingly backed a deal to buy the i newspaper from ESI Media for £24m.
It said the acquisition would give the company ""numerous revenue and cost synergy opportunities"", contribute positively to earnings and ""allow us to accelerate growth in digital, and help stabilise our circulation revenues"".
In its annual results statement, the owner of The Scotsman and more than 200 other titles said ""challenging trading conditions"" in the second half of last year had continued into 2016.
Total revenues for the first eight weeks of this year were down 13% ""against strong year-on-year comparatives"" in the first quarter of 2015.
Other Johnston Press financial highlights for 2015:
In January the group revealed plans to cut editorial jobs across its operations in the UK, as part of a drive to cut costs following a decline in revenue.
Chief executive Ashley Highfield said: ""We have reduced costs to maintain profitability, reset our portfolio and refocused on priority markets with attractive audiences that offer the best opportunity for growth.
""Success in driving our national display advertising business in 2015 and the rollout of our local display advertising sales force initiative gives me confidence for the future despite the fact that the market remains difficult.""
The company stated that this year it would ""focus on and invest in our primary brands, operating in growth markets with attractive audiences"".
Johnston added: ""We have identified a number of newsbrands that are now considered non-core and such will be either divested or run with less costs, reflecting the medium-term outlook for the identified assets that fall into this category.

Mr Nolan said: ""This judgement makes me question Ofsted's credibility.""

Depp, 52, and Heard met while co-starring in the 2011 film The Rum Diary.
In the court papers, Texan-born Heard listed the separation date as Sunday.
Celebrity news website TMZ reported that Depp had asked a judge to reject Heard's claim for spousal support.
The split comes days after the death of Depp's mother. His latest film, Alice Through the Looking Glass, is due to be released on Friday.
The Australian court case started last year when Heard brought two dogs into the country where her husband was filming the latest movie in the Pirates of the Caribbean series.
When the case was settled, the couple released a video apology expressing remorse and advising travellers to respect Australian quarantine laws.
However, Australia's Deputy PM Barnaby Joyce had threatened to have the dogs put down, triggering a war of words with Depp that lasted for months.

The report said heavy rain over the Christmas period fell on ground already saturated following heavy rain throughout November and December.

It states: ""An improved system of flood defences in Tadcaster is a priority for the town.

But despite the church's best efforts the bats are not moving and are soiling the altar and church furniture, leaving the church with an ""appalling smell"".

Volunteers at the church have been working for the past decade to keep the altar, stonework and woodwork clean.
But the bats, roosting in the higher areas of the church continually soil the interior of the building with urine and faeces.
Church warden Liz Cowley said keeping the 11th Century building in good shape was difficult.
She said: ""You can see the urine marks (on the altar), they won't go away.
""If people were coming in here damaging an ancient building like this, you would say it was criminal damage.
""The smell is appalling, it's a combination of ammonia from the urine and a musty smell from the droppings that catches at the back of the throat.""
Members of the church had spent Â£10,000 trying to get the bats to move and had paid for specially-built lofts nearby.
The Rev Paul Mothersdale, the Rector of St Hilda's Church, said a lot of money had been invested in trying to persuade the bats to move out of the church.
The Rev Mothersdale said: ""We've tried to do everything that English Nature, or Natural England, have wanted us to do.

Prosecutors and security officials said DNA tests had identified the bomber as Abdulbaki Somer, born in the eastern Turkish city of Van.
Last week's bombing killed 29 people, at least 20 of them military personnel.
""The bomber's DNA matches that of Abdulbaki's father,"" a senior Turkish security official told Reuters news agency.
Turkey's state-run Anadolu news agency quoted prosecutors confirming the report.
It said that Abdulbaki Somer was believed to have joined the Kurdish militant PKK group in 2005 at the age of 16 and was based in the Qandil mountains in northern Iraq until 2014.
The agency said that Somer's father had told police that his son was behind the attack.
Following the blast in Ankara, Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu named the bomber as Salih Necar, a Syrian national and member of the Syrian Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG).
""Whatever the judicial inquiry concludes over the identity of the bomber, it is clear that the bomber came from Rojava, the area of the PYD,"" Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmus told reporters on Tuesday, referring to another Syrian Kurd-controlled northern Syria.
He said the bomber had entered Turkey from the region in the summer of 2014.

The incident happened at the Asda petrol station at the Phoenix Retail Park in Linwood on 10 September 2014.

Fans raised Â£60,000 for the tribute which was made in a Czech foundry.
Hundreds of people attended an unveiling ceremony earlier, many in fancy dress for the occasion.
Neil Taylor, who helped raise the donations for the statue, said its installation would mean that ""Frank will gaze on the Timperley sunset forever"".
He said: ""You either got the humour or you didn't get the humour.
""Frank Sidebottom created a whole world, he was just magical. He just made a very modest living entertaining people and that's what he's enjoying doing.""
Sievey set his character's life in the village, where he lived himself, and, as Frank, hosted tours of the area for fans.
He often referenced Timperley in his TV and music work, notably on his 1987 release, The Timperley EP, which featured a version of The Kinks' 1967 song Waterloo Sunset with altered lyrics that referred extensively to the village.
He also covered Sex Pistols' Anarchy in the UK, changing its title to Anarchy in Timperley.
Although best known for Frank Sidebottom, Sievey also had success in the late 1970s with his punk band The Freshies, who had a hit with I'm In Love With The Girl On The Manchester Virgin Megastore Checkout Desk.
His TV fame peaked in the early 1990s with his own series Frank Sidebottom's Fantastic Shed Show.

37303922,"On Tuesday Mr Obama cancelled planned talks after the firebrand Mr Duterte called him the ""son of a whore"".
Wednesday's informal meeting took place before an Asean summit gala dinner.
While a Philippine spokesman said he was ""very happy"" it happened, the US side said they had a ""brief discussion"" in a pre-meal ""hold space"" for leaders.
Mr Obama and Mr Duterte are said to have entered the dinner venue separately at the summit in Laos and did not interact with each other during the event, which lasted one hour and 20 minutes.
""They were the last people to leave the holding room. I can't say how long they met,"" Philippine Foreign Secretary Perfecto Yasay, travelling with Mr Duterte, told reporters shortly afterwards.
""I'm very happy that it happened.""
A White House official said the pair exchanged ""pleasantries"" in a ""brief discussion"" before dinner.
War on drugs
Mr Duterte's outburst came after at a press conference where he told reporters he would not accept Mr Obama raising any concerns about the war on drugs in the Philippines.
""You must be respectful. Do not just throw away questions and statements. Son of a whore, I will curse you in that forum,"" Mr Duterte said, apparently in reference to the US president.
What else has the controversial Filipino president said?
Summit diplomacy, Duterte-style
World leaders' offensive insults: Who's top?
From 'Punisher' to president: Who is Rodrigo Duterte?
The  Filipino leader later expressed regret over the remarks, but not before Mr Obama had cancelled a planned meeting.
Mr Duterte won the presidency with his hard-line policy to eradicate drugs and some 2,400 people have died in anti-drug operations since he took office in June.
He had previously urged citizens to shoot to kill drug dealers who resisted arrest, and threatened to ""separate"" from the UN after it called his war on drugs a crime under international law.
President Duterte, known for his controversial remarks, had previously called US Secretary of State John Kerry ""crazy"" and referred to Pope Francis as the ""son of a whore"".

Hundreds of riot police had been deployed around the Supreme Court in the capital, Islamabad.
Blasphemy is a highly sensitive issue in Pakistan - critics argue laws are frequently misused to settle personal scores, often targeting minorities.
Last year the Supreme Court suspended Asia Bibi's death sentence and gave her leave to appeal.
A new date for the hearing has yet to be set.
Judge Iqbal Hameed ur Rehman, one of three set to hear the appeal, recused himself from the case on Thursday.
""I was a part of the bench that was hearing the case of Salmaan Taseer, and this case is related to that,"" he told the court, AFP reports.
Mr Taseer was the liberal governor of Punjab province. He was killed by his own bodyguard in Islamabad in 2011 after speaking out for Asia Bibi.
Family in hiding
Asia Bibi was the first woman to be sentenced to death under Pakistan's blasphemy laws and her case is one of the most controversial.
She was sentenced to hang in 2010 for insulting the Prophet Muhammad during an argument with Muslim women which began over a cup of water. She denies the charge.
Thousands have protested against her and said they would kill her if she were ever released - including the imam in her own village. Her husband and four daughters live in hiding and say they have received many death threats.
Asia Bibi's death sentence had been confirmed by the High Court in Punjab province in October, although no date was set.
Correspondents said the granting of leave to appeal by the Supreme Court was the first glimmer of hope for her family.
Her lawyers say the trial and subsequent appeal in the Punjab high court were flawed.
Pakistan has never executed anyone for blasphemy but some people accused of the offence have been lynched by crowds. Lawyers, judges and those seeking to reform the blasphemy laws have also been threatened, attacked or even killed.
Since the 1990s, scores of Christians have been convicted for desecrating the Koran or for blasphemy.

Paul Pate, the top election official in Iowa, condemned the mailers on Saturday, saying the state does not track or grade individual voters.
Mr Pate said Mr Cruz's mailers ""misrepresent Iowa election law"" and that they were ""not in keeping in the spirit of the Iowa Caucuses,"" but he stopped short of any official action.
""Ted Cruz didn't win Iowa, he stole it. That is why all of the polls were so wrong and why he got far more votes than anticipated. Bad!"" Mr Trump said.
Earlier, he wrote on Twitter that Mr Cruz ""illegally"" won the caucus, but later deleted the tweet.
The reaction contrasts with his concession speech on Monday night, which was seen as a humble departure from his usual bombastic style.
Mr Trump placed second in Monday's contest, which he called ""a long-shot great finish"" in an earlier tweet.
Mr Cruz's camp is not taking the accusations too seriously.
""Reality just hit the reality star - he lost Iowa and now nobody is talking about him, so he's popping off on Twitter,"" Mr Cruz's communications director Rick Tyler told Politico in an email.

Paul Pate, the top election official in Iowa, condemned the mailers on Saturday, saying the state does not track or grade individual voters.
Mr Pate said Mr Cruz's mailers ""misrepresent Iowa election law"" and that they were ""not in keeping in the spirit of the Iowa Caucuses,"" but he stopped short of any official action.
""Ted Cruz didn't win Iowa, he stole it. That is why all of the polls were so wrong and why he got far more votes than anticipated. Bad!"" Mr Trump said.
Earlier, he wrote on Twitter that Mr Cruz ""illegally"" won the caucus, but later deleted the tweet.
The reaction contrasts with his concession speech on Monday night, which was seen as a humble departure from his usual bombastic style.
Mr Trump placed second in Monday's contest, which he called ""a long-shot great finish"" in an earlier tweet.
Mr Cruz's camp is not taking the accusations too seriously.
""Reality just hit the reality star - he lost Iowa and now nobody is talking about him, so he's popping off on Twitter,"" Mr Cruz's communications director Rick Tyler told Politico in an email.
""There are support groups for Twitter addiction, perhaps he should find his local chapter.""
There is no precedent for re-doing a caucus.
The remaining candidates are now in New Hampshire, the next state to hold a primary vote, where Mr Trump is leading in the polls.
Rand Paul, a Republican who represents the Libertarian wing on the party, dropped out of the race on Wednesday after finishing fifth in Iowa.","Candidate Trump has accused the winner, Ted Cruz, of fraud in the Iowa election.","Candidate Trump has accused the winner, Ted Cruz, of fraud in the Iowa election.",1,bart-base,xsum,1

The ministry called on countries fighting IS to give peshmerga fighters equipment for protection against chemical attacks. Several countries including the United States are already giving military assistance to the Kurdish fighters.
This is not the first time IS has been accused of using chemical weapons. In March, Kurdish authorities in Iraq said they had evidence that IS had used chlorine gas.

19862265,"No Windfarm at Gayton (NOWAG) and East Lindsey District Council both oppose the planning application.
The protest march on Sunday morning raised money for legal costs as well as highlighting the campaign.
The developers say wind turbines contribute to renewable energy targets and help combat climate change.
But campaigner Melvin Grosvenor, who is working with NOWAG, questioned how efficiently the turbines would generate energy.
""It's a huge price for Lincolnshire to pay to host a suspect technology,"" he said.
""The developers say we need renewable energy, but at what cost to the landscape?""
Earlier this year Lincolnshire County Council issued a statement advising district councils not to grant planning permission if wind farms fail to meet strict criteria.
The council's leader, Martin Hill, said he did not want Lincolnshire to be ""covered by a forest of the things"".
Mr Grosvenor said wind turbines have more of a visual impact in Lincolnshire because the landscape is relatively flat.
""The issue we've got with Lincolnshire is because it's predominantly big open skies there are few visual detractors, and of course you've got the Lincolnshire Wolds [an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty],"" he said.
About 60 campaigners walked from near Theddlethorpe Church to Great Carlton, and many were sponsored.
They walked along a bridleway known as the Two Mile Bank, where the turbines would be erected.
The campaigners also flew a blimp at about 377ft (115m) to demonstrate the maximum height of the turbines.
There are already wind farms at Gayton le Marsh and Theddlethorpe, and Mr Grosvenor said the proposed turbines would ""give the impression of a continuous line of turbines on the landscape.""

The council waived its own financial rules three times when granting Core Fit Ltd contracts totalling £156,000.
Mr Jones said he was ""clear"" that he had ""not misled council"".
The fitness company runs classes in schools and is owned by Mr Jones's personal physiotherapist, Amanda Morris. Neither Ms Morris nor her company have commented on the claims.
Mr Jones has previously said he had publicly declared his interest in the firm, while a council spokesman said there had been no ""unlawful expenditure or any breach of EU procurement rules"".
However, Ms Gaddum said Mr Jones had ""misled"" councillors at a meeting in October, where he questioned why his link with the company was ""being brought up"", and had lobbied for it to receive help.
The BBC has seen a letter written by Mr Jones to local MP George Osborne - whose Tatton constituency is included within Cheshire East - in which work carried out by Ms Morris's company is praised.
Emails released following a BBC Freedom of Information Act request show Mr Jones helped Ms Morris write a positive assessment of how Core Fit had fulfilled one of the council's contracts.

34988751,"Hilda Gaddum, the mayor of Cheshire East, said her fellow Conservative Michael Jones's position had become ""untenable"".
The council waived its own financial rules three times when granting Core Fit Ltd contracts totalling £156,000.
Mr Jones said he was ""clear"" that he had ""not misled council"".
The fitness company runs classes in schools and is owned by Mr Jones's personal physiotherapist, Amanda Morris. Neither Ms Morris nor her company have commented on the claims.
Mr Jones has previously said he had publicly declared his interest in the firm, while a council spokesman said there had been no ""unlawful expenditure or any breach of EU procurement rules"".
However, Ms Gaddum said Mr Jones had ""misled"" councillors at a meeting in October, where he questioned why his link with the company was ""being brought up"", and had lobbied for it to receive help.
The BBC has seen a letter written by Mr Jones to local MP George Osborne - whose Tatton constituency is included within Cheshire East - in which work carried out by Ms Morris's company is praised.
Emails released following a BBC Freedom of Information Act request show Mr Jones helped Ms Morris write a positive assessment of how Core Fit had fulfilled one of the council's contracts.

Ms Gaddum said she had written to Mr Jones asking for his resignation, which led to ""a very, very difficult meeting with him"".
In a statement, Mr Jones said he would ""not be resigning but thank the mayor for recognising the many good things I have achieved"".

He was drafted by the Marlins in 2011 at 20 years old and named National League Rookie of the Year in 2013.
The Miami Herald reported his grandmother, a loyal supporter, often stood on her roof in Cuba during his games to listen to the sports radio broadcast as her grandson played.

Arshid, 40, and Basharat, 39, were found guilty by a jury of 50 offences.
Bannaras, 36, pleaded guilty to 10 offences before the trial started.
Michelle Colborne QC said Bannaras Hussain met one victim when she was 12 or 13 and she performed sex acts on him.
""He was indifferent to whether she consented or not,"" she said.
""When her brothers found out, they were furious with her and would physically assault her because she was involved sexually with an Asian man.""
She said Bannaras abused one victim in a car park next to Rotherham Police Station, and told the court how the sister of another of his victims described her sister as a ""broken human being"".
Ms Colborne said one woman had described the Hussain brothers as ""a pack of animals"".
Summing up the contents of a number of statements from the women abused by the brothers, she said: ""They describe from their teenage years a life in the main of feeling dirty, ashamed and guilty.
""Between them, a plethora of emotional conditions - eating disorders, self-harm, agoraphobia, self-loathing and terminations for many of them from the age of 14 - events they have never been able to put behind them.""
She said many of the victims have had relationship problems throughout their lives and have found themselves subjected to domestic violence.
Three associates of the Hussain brothers, their uncle Qurban Ali, 53, Karen MacGregor, 58, and Shelley Davies, 40, will also be sentenced.

A lawyer acting for PIP strongly denied the report, telling RTL that the product was not industrial but a food product used in lipstick.
The company was shut down in 2010.
RTL had the implant examined by a chemistry and toxicology researcher who alleged that the materials used, which also included Silopren and Rhodorsil, had caused the high rupture rate from the silicone gel implants.
Although the French health safety agency was already aware the defective implants contained industrial rather than medical grade silicone, no mention has been made of additives from the petrol industry.
PIP breast implants: Your stories
The British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons said earlier that the silicone was believed to have been made for mattresses but a lawyer acting for French implant-wearers said the composition of the implant varied.
French authorities have advised 30,000 women in France to have the PIP implants removed as a precaution because of an estimated 5% rupture rate.
The French health safety agency says it has registered 1,143 ruptures and 495 inflammatory reactions from the implants.
An estimated 300-400,000 women were given the implants, mainly in Latin America and elsewhere in Europe.
In the UK, 40,000 women have been advised by the government not to have them removed although ministers have ordered a review of data used to assess the risk of the implant leaking.
A surgeon advising the British government, Tim Goodacre, told the BBC on Monday that the failure rate was ""quite out of the ordinary"" and he said they should be removed on ""a staged basis"".
No link has been made between ruptured implants and cancer.
PIP's lawyer, Yves Haddad, has insisted the fuel additive allegations are completely unfounded.

Mr Parsons said he believed the chairman's role is to make sure the meeting runs smoothly and efficiently but added it is not his place to ""give councillors a nudge"".
But the former MP for Stroud, Neil Carmichael disagreed. He said it was ""wrong"" that councillors fell asleep ""during such an important meeting on such a critical subject"".
""As chairman of the Commons Select Committee I felt it was very much my job to ensure that meetings were run briskly and that all those present were fully engaged throughout,"" the Conservative said.

Fellow Tory Rob Bird said he may have ""closed his eyes for a moment"", while Liberal Democrat John Cordwell admitted he ""might have nodded off very briefly"". Both men insisted they were aware of the proceedings.
But Labour's Graham Morgan was more forthright though, stating: ""Those meetings drag a bit and I'm 66.""

40455154,"The debate, on Thursday, was discussing ""serious and widespread failures"" in Gloucestershire's children's service.
Cllr Shaun Parsons, chairman of the council, said members had been told the proceedings were being televised.
Two said they had been listening, one blamed medication, but the fourth admitted the meetings ""drag a bit"".
Mr Parsons said he believed the chairman's role is to make sure the meeting runs smoothly and efficiently but added it is not his place to ""give councillors a nudge"".
But the former MP for Stroud, Neil Carmichael disagreed. He said it was ""wrong"" that councillors fell asleep ""during such an important meeting on such a critical subject"".
""As chairman of the Commons Select Committee I felt it was very much my job to ensure that meetings were run briskly and that all those present were fully engaged throughout,"" the Conservative said.
Four councillors were spotted nodding off, including deputy leader, Conservative Ray Theodoulou who blamed his heart medication for making him ""a little drowsy"".
Fellow Tory Rob Bird said he may have ""closed his eyes for a moment"", while Liberal Democrat John Cordwell admitted he ""might have nodded off very briefly"". Both men insisted they were aware of the proceedings.
But Labour's Graham Morgan was more forthright though, stating: ""Those meetings drag a bit and I'm 66.""

Dunne, who had enjoyed a two-shot lead going into the final round, found trouble off the tee and failed to get up and down from a greenside bunker.

Sightings of the animal sparked a search involving hundreds of emergency services workers, animal-trackers and a helicopter.
But experts now say the animal is most likely a much less dangerous animal, such as a lynx or large domestic cat.
They made their conclusions based on inspecting animal tracks.
It remains unclear where the animal came from, though there is a big cat park near Montevrain.
A source told AFP that the search had been scaled back for the moment and the helicopter grounded, although forces remained ""mobilised"" in case of a fresh alert.
The BBC's Hugh Schofield in Paris says police had suggested there was probably not too much to worry about, but the authorities still sent out officers with guns and tranquilisers.
The hunt has focused on areas near the Disneyland Paris theme park.
There was a fresh alert on Friday morning after paw prints were discovered near a service station east of Paris.
To reach there, the animal had apparently crossed the A4 motorway.
Police guarded the entrances to schools in the Montevrain area in case the cat turned up, as a helicopter with thermal imaging hovered.
Local residents were asked to stay indoors and parents urged to take their children to and from school by car.
A dozen or so soldiers from a nearby army base joined police and fire officials combing the countryside outside Montevrain.
A huntsman, officially designated as a ""wolf catcher"", who has a specially trained dog, was also part of the search team.
The owner of the lntermarche supermarket in Montevrain said on Thursday that his wife had spotted the animal at about 08:30 (07:30 GMT).
""She didn't get out of the car and called me to say 'I think I saw a lynx',"" he was quoted as saying. The woman took a photograph that appears to show a large cat.

33681460,"Fifa president Sepp Blatter announced plans last week to form an 11-person panel to review football's scandal-hit world governing body.
Domenico Scala had earlier said he would only lead the taskforce if he is guaranteed full independence.
The Swiss businessman is already the independent chair of Fifa's audit and compliance committee.
Scala was believed to have been prepared to lead the taskforce, after meeting presidents of three of Fifa's six continental confederations.
But a spokesman for Scala told BBC Sport: ""Domenico Scala never applied for such a chairmanship.""
He added that the post would only be considered ""under the strict condition"" that ""independence was guaranteed"".
As well as an independent chair, the taskforce will have two representatives from the AFC (Asia), CAF (Africa), Concacaf (North, Central America and the Caribbean) and Uefa (Europe), as well as one representative from each of Conmebol (South America) and the OFC (Oceania).
In a statement, Fifa said representatives from federations would not necessarily have to be ""members of the football community"" and the confederations could decide that themselves.
Blatter, who has announced his intention to stand down as president, has said presidential term limits and integrity checks for top officials are potential areas of reform.
Recommendations are due to be presented at the next meeting of Fifa's executive committee in Zurich on 24 and 25 September.
The prospect of Scala leading an independent review of Fifa was described as ""laughable"" by campaign group New Fifa Now.
And Alexandra Wrage, who resigned from Fifa's independent governance committee in April 2013 in protest at a lack of meaningful action, said even an independent chairman of the reform taskforce ""can't work"".
She told BBC Sport: ""The process needs to be taken out of Fifa's hands. Short of that, it's another reform dead-end.""
Blatter's resignation on 2 June followed the arrest of seven Fifa officials as part of a United States investigation that saw 14 people indicted on corruption charges.

21708464,"NHS managers have proposed a temporary downgrade of the hospital's maternity and paediatric services to cope with staffing shortages.
The board of East Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust will make a decision on Friday.
One paediatric nurse, who asked not to be named, said staff were devastated for their patients.
She said: ""It's going to mean that many more children will have to make journeys across to Hastings at a time when they are particularly vulnerable.
""They're sick. Their families are vulnerable. And I think it's going to have massive implications for children who are sick and for children who are long-term disabled.""
The NHS trust said the changes were being brought in for safety reasons because it was unable to recruit suitable specialist doctors which had led to an over-reliance on temporary and agency staff.
Several options are being considered, but the trust has said its preferred plan is to have consultant-led obstetric services, neonatal services including the special care baby unit, in-patient paediatric services and emergency gynaecology services at the Conquest Hospital in Hastings.
Eastbourne hospital would have a stand-alone midwifery-led maternity unit and enhanced paediatric care.
Paediatrician Dr David Scott said: ""They [patients] will get a better service if they go to Hastings because they will get staff who will be better trained.
""There will be greater consultant availability so they will see more senior better trained staff. It will also allow us to increase the levels of nursing care available on the ward.""

A police guard remains in place at the bungalow while recovery work is carried out.
Pete Wiles, from the fire service, said: ""If they hadn't moved... they would have been hit.

Their delay was ordered after lists of candidates for Fatah, which dominates the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority, were cancelled in parts of the Gaza Strip, which is run by Hamas.
Hamas has protested at the court's ruling, describing it as ""political"".
Fatah said it held Hamas fully responsible.
Thursday's ruling by the high court in the West Bank city of Ramallah came after a Hamas-controlled court in Gaza disqualified several candidate lists drawn up by Fatah on technical grounds.
A challenge was also lodged by a lawyer over the inability to hold the vote in East Jerusalem, which Israel annexed after seizing it in the 1967 war but Palestinians want to be the capital of a future state.
""Elections can't take place in one place and not the other,"" said the presiding judge.
""The elections can't take place in Jerusalem and its neighbourhoods. Also, there are problems with the formation of courts in Gaza... Therefore, the court decides to stop the elections.""
Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri blamed Fatah for the delay.
""The high court decision is politically motivated and it came in order to rescue Fatah after its lists of candidates collapsed in a number of areas,"" he told the Reuters news agency.
But Osama al-Qawasmi of Fatah rejected the allegation, saying: ""We hold Hamas fully responsible for foiling the election, starting with the unjustified petitions it filed.""
The election would have been the first involving Hamas and Fatah since the 2006 poll for the Palestinian Legislative Council, in which Hamas won a majority.

The equipment was meant for the fight against Boko Haram Islamist militants.
Mr Dasuki was picked up early in the morning by security agents, a PR firm representing him said.
Two weeks ago, President Muhammadu Buhari ordered Mr Dasuki's arrest after he was indicted by a panel investigating the procurement of arm under the last administration of former President Goodluck Jonathan.
PRNigeria said he was picked up by intelligence agents from his home in the capital, Abuja, where he was already under house arrest facing separate charges.
Later on Tuesday, the former governor of Sokoto state, Attahiru Bafarawa and owner of a Lagos-based private TV station, Raymond Dokpesi, were detained separately by Nigeria's Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), in connection with the alleged fraud.
Both men, who are political allies of the former president, have denied any involvement in the arms deal.
Their arrest follows those of some of Mr Dasuki's associates by EFCC on Monday.
The anti-corruption body said they included former Minister of State for Finance Bashir Yuguda and the sons of some prominent politicians of the former ruling party over allegations of impropriety in relation to the arm deal.
Earlier, Mr Dasuki said he had not been given a chance to defend himself before the investigative panel and described its recommendation as ""politically motivated"".
The former army colonel is already facing a trial for allegedly possessing illegal firearms.
He is the first senior official of the former government to be charged under the rule of President Muhammadu Buhari, who took in office in May.
The BBC's Martin Patience in Lagos says Mr Dasuki's arrest will reinforce President Buhari's message that he will not tolerate corruption no matter how senior the official.

Mr Peres, who was one of the last of a generation of Israeli politicians present at the new nation's birth in 1948, served twice as the country's prime minister and once as president.
He won the Nobel Peace prize in 1994 for his role negotiating peace accords with the Palestinians a year earlier.
He once said the Palestinians were Israel's ""closest neighbours"" and might become its ""closest friends"".
Obituary: Shimon Peres, Israeli founding father
Long legacy of Israel's elder statesman
Mr Peres died in a hospital near Tel Aviv early on Wednesday, with his family at his bedside.
He had been in the intensive care unit of the Sheba Medical Centre after suffering a major stroke on 13 September.
Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed his ""deep personal grief on the passing of the beloved of the nation"".
Meanwhile US President Barack Obama called Mr Peres his ""dear friend"" in a statement, and said: ""He was guided by a vision of the human dignity and progress that he knew people of goodwill could advance together.""
Mr Peres shared his Nobel Peace Prize with Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who was later assassinated, and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
At the start of his long political career, he was put in charge of personnel and arms purchases for the Haganah, the predecessor of the Israel Defense Forces.
He secured a deal with France to supply the new Israeli nation with Mirage jet fighters. He also set up Israel's secret nuclear facility.
He was the defence minister in 1976, when Palestinian hijackers diverted a plane from Israel to Entebbe in Uganda. He oversaw the successful rescue of more than 100 hostages.
Once an advocate of Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank, Mr Peres later became a leading political dove. He often spoke of the need for compromise over territorial demands in Palestinian areas.
He maintained an active public schedule into old age, mostly through his non-governmental Peres Centre for Peace, which promotes closer ties between Israel and the Palestinians.
In 2013 he said: ""There is no alternative to peace. There is no sense to go to war.""

16055896,"The UK government gave Northern Ireland the power to reduce the level of the tax because it said it had a special economic case.
That prompted calls from Scottish and Welsh airports for similar treatment.
The UK Treasury said it had not ruled out devolving APD to Scotland and Wales in the future.
A report published following a consultation on reform of APD said the government at Westminster would ""continue to explore the feasibility and likely effects of devolution to Scotland and Wales"".
Earlier this year Chancellor George Osborne announced the duty would be cut for direct long-haul routes from Northern Ireland airports, and he would devolve control over the tax to the Northern Irish Assembly.
The move came in response to fears that some routes could be scrapped due to competition from Irish airports where APD is much lower.
Commenting on the UK Government's decision not to grant the Scottish government similar powers for now, Jim O'Sullivan, managing director of Edinburgh Airport, said: ""APD is already costing Scotland passengers and having an impact on tourism revenues.
""We know from discussions with our airline partners that it is a major factor in their decision to connect further routes to Scotland.
""We would urge the Westminster Government to see Scotland as it does Northern Ireland and understand the need to both reduce and devolve this unfair and damaging tax.""

35557558,"The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) says GSK made more than £50m of payments to companies making generic versions of its anti-depressant Seroxat to delay them coming to market.
GSK has been fined £37,606,275 and the generic firms have to pay £7.4m.
But GSK says its actions actually saved the NHS money and brought the generic drugs to the market sooner.
The other companies fined were Generics UK, Merck, Alpharma, Activis UK and Xellia Pharmaceuticals.
The CMA found that between 2002 and 2004, GSK had made agreements to pay cash to its competitors to prevent them bringing the generic version of Seroxat, called paroxetine, to market.
In addition to the cash payments, the CMA said the deals allowed the competitors to bring small amounts of paroxetine to market instead of GSK, transferring some of the profits to the generic manufacturers without increasing competition.
Michael Grenfell from the CMA said: ""Today's decision sends out a strong message that we will tackle illegal behaviour that is designed to stifle competition at the expense of customers - in this case, the NHS and, ultimately, taxpayers.""
But GSK said it disagreed with the ruling and was considering appealing.
""GSK and the generics companies entered into these agreements at the time in order to settle costly, complex and uncertain patent disputes,"" its spokesperson said.
""The agreements allowed the generics companies to enter the market early with a paroxetine product and ultimately enabled a saving of over £15m to the NHS.""

38844652,"John Stevenson Wright was sentenced at Manchester Crown Court to 18 months for sexually abusing Darren Kenny.
The court heard the offences took place when Wright worked at a pub run by Mr Kenny's parents in Rochdale.
Wright, 68, abused Mr Kenny as a teenager when he used to sleep over at the pub.
He was convicted of gross indecency, indecent assault and inciting a child under 16 to engage in a sexual act between 1978 and 1981.
Wright's sentence will be added to the 22 years he is already serving for sexually abusing boys.
Mr Kenny, 50, an officer with Greater Manchester Police in Tameside, was repeatedly abused as a teenager and thought Wright was dead until he typed his name into an internet search engine.
While looking for his abuser's obituary, he was ""horrified"" to learn Wright had been jailed for child sexual abuse in Rochdale.
He added: ""We had been told he had died - I had my closure and then when we found out he wasn't dead I had no closure any more and I needed it back.""
Mr Kenny, who has waived his right to anonymity, contacted the officer who had investigated Wright and said: ""I've got another victim - me.
""Even if wasn't a policeman I would have come forward.
""The length of sentence isn't important... returning the guilty verdict is what is important.""
Mr Kenny encouraged other abuse victims to speak out.

35767640,"The charred pine twigs date back 140 million years to a time when fires raged across large tracts of land.
Pine trees now dominate the forests of the Northern Hemisphere.
The research suggests the tree's evolution was shaped in the fiery landscape of the Cretaceous, where oxygen levels were much higher than today, fuelling intense and frequent wildfires.
""Pines are well adapted to fire today,"" said Dr Howard Falcon-Lang of Royal Holloway, University of London, who discovered the fossils in Nova Scotia, Canada.
""The fossils show that wildfires raged through the earliest pine forests and probably shaped the evolution of this important tree.""
The specimens, which are described in Geology journal, were preserved as charcoal within rocks from a quarry.
""It was only when I digested [the samples] in acid that these beautiful fossils fell out,"" Dr Falcon-Lang told BBC News.
""They were sitting in my cupboard for five years before I actually worked out what was there.""
The fossils are just a few mm long but probably came from trees resembling the Scots Pine that now cover large areas of Scotland.
Pines are well adapted to fire, containing inflammable deadwood that makes them burn easily.
They also produce cones that will only germinate after being scorched, ensuring a new generation of trees is seeded after the fire has passed by and other vegetation has been destroyed.
Scientists have debated for many years why some trees seem to thrive on wildfires.
""One of the oddities about pine trees today is that they are one of the most fire adapted species on our planet,"" explained Dr Falcon-Lang.
""These oldest pine fossils are preserved as charcoal, the product of fire, suggesting that the co-occurrence of fire and pines is something that's very ancient, that goes back to the very origin of these first pine trees.""
Dr Falcon-Lang plans to return to the quarry this summer to recover more specimens.
He hopes to find fossils of flowering plants, which were evolving at the same time as the ancient pines.

The 2014 European 100m champion held off the fast-finishing James Ellington and his friend and rival CJ Ujah in a showdown that lived up to expectations.
Earlier his training partner Asha Philip won her third British 100m title to join him in the GB team for Rio.
Tiffany Porter beat her younger sister Cindy Ofili in the 100m hurdles.
The 28-year-old Dasaolu got out of his blocks well as Ellington was left, and held a metre lead at halfway.
With Richard Kilty and Harry Aikines-Aryeetey struggling, and veteran Dwain Chambers never in the picture, Ujah seemed the only threat to the man who ran 9.91 seconds at these championships three summers ago.
But Ellington came through late outside them to steal both second place and the second automatic Olympic place.
A tailwind of three metres per second added a gloss to the times - 9.93 secs for Dasaolu, 9.96 for Ellington and 9.97 for Ujah - but with Britain's 200m men also in form, the GB sprint relay squad appears in excellent shape going to Brazil.
""Seven guys on the line had the [Olympic qualifying] standard, so I knew that if I didn't finish top two, top three, my dream of going to Rio in the 100m was in jeopardy,"" said Dasaolu.
""Top three under 10 seconds in the same race bodes well for the relay and for sprinting as a whole. Jamaica and America are out there, but if they make any mistakes we'll be nipping at their heels and ready to go for the gold.""

In the absence of British record holder Dina Asher-Smith - focusing on the longer sprint this weekend - from the women's 100m, Philip upset pre-race favourite Desiree Henry as she dominated in 11.17 secs, with 19-year-old talent Daryll Neita taking second in 11.24 and Henry in third.

Hacking was directed at Russian and US government officials, including security, diplomatic and military personnel, according to the DOJ.
The indictment also alleged that 30 million Yahoo accounts were commandeered without authorisation for use in a spam campaign.
""We will not allow individuals, groups, nation states, or a combination of them to compromise the privacy of our citizens, the economic interests of our companies, or the security of our country,"" said acting attorney general Mary McCord, announcing the charges.

One of the alleged hackers has been on of the FBI's most wanted cyber criminals for more than three years, according to acting Att Gen McCord.
The suspect in question, Alexsey Belan, was aided by the FSB who - according to the DOJ - provided him with ""sensitive FSB law enforcement and intelligence information that would have helped him avoid detection by US and other law enforcement agencies outside Russia"".
""We would hope [Russia] would respect our criminal justice system and respect these charges,"" said acting Att Gen McCord, acknowledging the fact that the US does not have an extradition treaty with Russia.
""The United Kingdom's MI5 made substantial contributions to the advancement of this investigation,"" added FBI executive assistant director Paul Abbate.

The suspect in question, Alexsey Belan, was aided by the FSB who - according to the DOJ - provided him with ""sensitive FSB law enforcement and intelligence information that would have helped him avoid detection by US and other law enforcement agencies outside Russia"".
""We would hope [Russia] would respect our criminal justice system and respect these charges,"" said acting Att Gen McCord, acknowledging the fact that the US does not have an extradition treaty with Russia.
""The United Kingdom's MI5 made substantial contributions to the advancement of this investigation,"" added FBI executive assistant director Paul Abbate.
Yahoo was criticised for the delay in informing users about the 2014 breach.
The stolen data included names, email addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth and encrypted passwords, but not credit card data, according to Yahoo.
Last year, users were advised to change their passwords.
Around eight million UK accounts were believed to have been affected - including some users of BT and Sky email services.
""The indictment unequivocally shows the attacks on Yahoo were state-sponsored,"" Yahoo said in a statement, responding to the DOJ announcement.
""We are deeply grateful to the FBI for investigating these crimes and the DOJ for bringing charges against those responsible.""

Levi died in 2013 of internal bleeding. His mother Danielle Cassin is also accused of murder.

The incident happened in the living room of Mr Piper's Chelmsley Wood home after he banned the youngster from playing on a games console, she said.

31641645,"The ruling is likely to encourage thousands of passengers with similar claims in the UK.
Jet2 argued the compensation payments should be delayed pending the outcome of a similar case in the Netherlands.
But the judge at Liverpool County Court ruled that ""a line should now be drawn. Justice delayed is justice denied"".
The EU has ruled that airlines must pay compensation for delayed flights, but a number of airlines have yet to pay out.
Four airlines in the UK have made applications to delay payments: Jet2, Thomas Cook, Ryanair and WizzAir.
The Jet2 case heard in Liverpool involved Kim Allen, who claimed â‚¬400 (Â£292) compensation after an almost seven-hour delay when flying from Manchester to Malaga in 2012.
""We've all been kept waiting for so long, but I'm really happy with today's decision,"" she said after the judge's ruling.
""Hopefully now it's time for the airlines to pay us what the law says they should.""
Her solicitor, Kevin Clarke from Bott & Co, said he hoped ""the airlines will now finally face up to their obligations to passengers and to settle the hundreds of thousands of legitimate claims outstanding.
""Sadly, the history of their conduct over the last decade would tell us to expect yet another legal challenge.""
The issue stems from the 2004 European regulations that oblige airlines, in some cases, to pay compensation to passengers for cancellations and delays, if they are not due to extraordinary circumstances.
A further ruling by the European Court of Justice in 2009 confirmed that delayed passengers should be treated as if their flights had been cancelled, if the delay was longer than three hours, entitling them to cash compensation.
Despite the ruling, a number of airlines in the UK are still arguing that some technical problems should be classified as extraordinary circumstances, and as such, no compensation should be due.

24992485,"The alleged spying by the National Security Agency (NSA) ""must be explained and more importantly new trust must be built up for the future"", she told German MPs.
The allegations dominated the news during an EU summit last month.
Ms Merkel said the NSA affair was putting EU-US trade talks to the test.
She also said Germany's relations with the US ""are of paramount importance"".
The German government has said it is keen to hear directly from the fugitive NSA leaker Edward Snowden about the agency's collection of phone and internet data.
But Germany says it cannot offer him asylum because he would have to make his application on German soil.
According to his leaks, the NSA targeted communications among Washington's Western allies, including Ms Merkel's mobile phone and EU offices.
""The accusations are grave,"" Ms Merkel said in her statement on Monday. She did not comment specifically on the alleged bugging of her phone.
The Bundestag - Germany's lower house - is holding a special debate on the NSA spying allegations.
The scale of NSA surveillance in Germany is not clear, and last month Germany sent some senior officials to Washington to find out more.
German media report that the German secret services exchange intelligence with their US counterparts.

24992485,"The alleged spying by the National Security Agency (NSA) ""must be explained and more importantly new trust must be built up for the future"", she told German MPs.
The allegations dominated the news during an EU summit last month.
Ms Merkel said the NSA affair was putting EU-US trade talks to the test.
She also said Germany's relations with the US ""are of paramount importance"".
The German government has said it is keen to hear directly from the fugitive NSA leaker Edward Snowden about the agency's collection of phone and internet data.
But Germany says it cannot offer him asylum because he would have to make his application on German soil.
According to his leaks, the NSA targeted communications among Washington's Western allies, including Ms Merkel's mobile phone and EU offices.
""The accusations are grave,"" Ms Merkel said in her statement on Monday. She did not comment specifically on the alleged bugging of her phone.
The Bundestag - Germany's lower house - is holding a special debate on the NSA spying allegations.
The scale of NSA surveillance in Germany is not clear, and last month Germany sent some senior officials to Washington to find out more.
German media report that the German secret services exchange intelligence with their US counterparts.

Mr Glen said a tunnel was the only ""realistic solution"".
A government feasibility study is already under way to consider the various options for the road.
Speaking in a Westminster debate, Mr Glen said the road, which runs from Hampshire to Devon, had become the ""devil's highway"" and ""one of the most notorious traffic blackspots in the country"".
He joined other South West MPs calling for the government to consider the wider economic, environmental and safety benefits of improving the road.
However, he cautioned that any plans to turn part, or all, of the 92 mile (148km) road into a dual carriageway must include protection for Stonehenge.
Mr Glen said he had been told by English Heritage, the National Trust and the Council for British Archaeology that Stonehenge would be ""formally placed on the at-risk register,"" if a dual carriageway was constructed close to the historic site without adequate protection.
Plans for a tunnel were initially shelved in 2007 when the government said the estimated cost of Â£510m was too expensive.
""A poorly designed and badly executed"" dual carriageway which could ""undermine a 5,000 year old world heritage site is not an improvement worth fighting for,"" Mr Glen said.

Its most recent annual revenue was £9m, with £1.3m in pre-tax profit.
Last September, Stocktrade had £4.3bn of assets under management. The buyer said it now stands at £4.6bn, bringing 48,000 new customers.
That should increase the scale of Alliance Trust Savings to £11.5bn in assets under management, with 105,000 customers, allowing for more efficient operations.
It will also increase the Dundonians range of services, including telephone and online share dealing services for pension providers, building societies, company share schemes and corporate Individual Savings Accounts.
Brewin Dolphin said the sale would only clear a net gain of £1m, after paying for separation costs.
The deal still requires clearance from regulators, and is expected to close during this year.
Alliance Trust Savings was part of the strategy last month criticised by Elliott Advisers, the hedge fund and activist investor in parent company Alliance Trust.
In criticising the Dundee company's management, it succeeded in getting two new directors appointed. They could have sought to block further expansion of the financial retail platform. But it appears, from this deal, that they have agreed to expenditure on growth.

Microsoft owns Hotmail, a free email service now called Outlook.com.
John Frank, deputy general counsel for Microsoft, said it took ""extraordinary actions in this case"".
While the search was technically legal, he added Microsoft would consult outside counsel in the future.
Microsoft's actions came to light this week as part of a legal case by US prosecutors against an ex-Microsoft employee, Alex Kibalko, who was a Russian native based in the company's Lebanon office.
In 2012, Microsoft had been alerted to the fact that the blogger, whose identity was kept anonymous in the court papers, had been given some stolen lines of code from the not-yet-released Windows 8 operating system.
The blogger then posted screenshots of the unreleased Windows operating system to his blog.
To figure out the source of the leak, Microsoft began an investigation and, as part of that search, looked into the blogger's accounts to find out the name of the employee.
The search was legal because it fell within Microsoft's terms of service which state that the company can access information in accounts that are stored on its ""Communication Services"", which includes email, chat areas, forums, and other communication facilities.
The terms of service add: ""Microsoft reserves the right to review materials posted to the Communication Services and to remove any materials in its sole discretion.""

38225995,"In a leaked letter, Mr Skates said he was informed this was because of the current level of investment.
He meets Network Rail officials on Thursday after describing conditions for rail passengers as ""unacceptable"".
Network Rail said it was committed to working with the Welsh Government to get value for taxpayers' money.
Mr Skates has accused the company - which maintains tracks across the UK - of a lack of investment in clearing leaves this autumn, which cause damage to train wheels because of the extra braking pressure required.
He believes this has led to over-crowding and reduced punctuality of services as it forces more rolling stock to be removed from routes.
Arriva Trains Wales said 54 out of its fleet of 127 have had to be taken away for repairs this autumn - an increase of 54% on the same period last year.
In the letter seen by BBC Wales, sent last month to Network Rail's route managing director Andy Thomas, Mr Skates said Arriva Trains Wales raised concerns about the level of work being carried out to clear leaves from the lines.
He wrote: ""I have been informed that Network Rail responded that this was due to budgetary reasons and that at the current level of investment it would take 28 years to get the Welsh network up to the prescribed standard.""
A Network Rail spokesman said: ""We have jointly concluded with Arriva Trains Wales that the reduction in fleet availability cannot be solely related to Network Rail's autumn plan as we are increasing spend and activity.
""We are committed to working jointly with Arriva Trains Wales and the Welsh Government to ensure maximum value for taxpayers' money.""
In a debate at the Senedd on Wednesday, Plaid Cymru's economy spokesman Adam Price described current conditions for Welsh rail passengers as a ""national crisis"".
He referred to three examples on social media yesterday in which one passenger told of his experience of a train catching fire, one had been on an overcrowded service where a passenger fainted, and another claimed to have a seat for the first time in 11 months.
An Arriva Trains Wales spokesman denied one of its trains had caught fire, instead saying there was a problem with an exhaust.
He said: ""We understand and apologise for the frustrations around the capacity issues faced by commuters which has been made worse recently by the additional maintenance required on damaged train wheels caused by the autumn leaf-fall.

Responding to suggestions his successor as business secretary, Sajid Javid, had been slow to intervene, he said the government was ""reasonably cautious"" because of the ""economics of the industry"".
He said: ""They haven't done a complete U-turn, but they have acknowledged reality that government has an absolutely key role working alongside private business and I'm encouraged by that.

24177359,"It is the third time Vitalmiro Bastos Moura has been tried for Dorothy Stang's 2005 death after previous convictions were overturned.
Ms Stang, 73, campaigned for 30 years to save rainforest from the interests of wealthy landlords.
She had tried to block Moura's attempts to seize land and was shot six times.
Moura, who was convicted in 2007 and 2010 in verdicts that were subsequently overturned, was sentenced to 30 years in prison.
In the latest trial, the judge said Moura had acted in a cold-blooded and cowardly manner.
Prosecutors earlier said Moura and another rancher had hired gunmen to kill Ms Stang. Moura's lawyers argued there wasn't enough evidence linking him to the crime.
The death of Ms Stang in the northern state of Para became a symbol of the violent conflict for natural resources in Brazil's Amazon region.
In the past 30 years, more than 1,000 people have been killed in land disputes in Brazil, with some two-thirds of the murders happening in Para.
Ahead of the latest verdict, Ms Stang's sister, Barbara Richardson, said the repeated trials had been upsetting but had helped maintain a spotlight on the issues.

16931503,"Church members have voted to raise the cost of a wedding from £296 to £415 and for a funeral service from £102 to £160 from January next year.
The fees include the costs of lighting and administration for the first time.
The moves come despite a warning from some members of the Church's governing body, the General Synod, that the rises could have an impact on poorer couples.
The Rev Canon Simon Killwick, a vicar in Moss Side, Manchester, said: ""Such a fee increase seems to me hard to justify in times of financial austerity and even harder to justify in poor inner-city parishes.
""The Church of England ought not to be seen to be making a big increase at this time and ought not to be making it difficult for the poor to access these services at a time when a simple ceremony can be had at a register office for around £100.""
Canon Killwick said the right to waive fees in cases of hardship put clergy in the ""invidious position"" of means testing parishioners.
""Waiving can cause real ill feeling,"" he said. ""The poor don't want to be patronised by fees being waived, they want their church to be affordable to them.
""It would be a crying shame if poor people end up being married in register offices because the Church of England has priced them out of their parish church.""
But the Rt Rev John Packer, the Bishop of Ripon and Leeds, said the changes reflected the ""reality"" of the costs, and  reduced confusion over different fees being charged by different parishes.
He told the General Synod that the fees raised about £35m a year for the Church, including £15m towards the pay of clergy.
""The reality of what it costs matters, and it seems to me that those who are being married within our churches do understand that,"" he said.
The increases were approved after a 4% rise in the number of Church of England weddings in 2010.

He and fellow American owner Tim Keyes recently bought 29 acres of land there, near the city's Ice Arena.
Nelms spoke after the club revealed an operating loss of £530,000 to 31 May.
""They are not great, but they're nothing to worry about,"" Nelms said of the club's annual accounts, which showed that turnover had remained at about £4m.
""Football Partners Scotland, the major shareholder, funds any losses. We said we would do that from the get go.""
Nelms explained that missing out on a top-six finish in the Scottish Premiership - Dundee finished eighth - resulted in £200,000 less income than had been budgeted for.

Nelms pointed out that the maintenance bill for Dens Park had risen £50,000 on the previous year and an additional £500,000 would be required in the 2017 accounts because of rent increases.

The City Deal scheme will see eight council areas around Glasgow receive about £1bn from the UK and Scottish governments.
The councils also have the power to borrow extra cash.
The Glasgow and Clyde Valley City Deal involved massive investment by both the Scottish and UK governments last year.
Eight councils - Glasgow, East Renfrewshire, Renfrewshire, Inverclyde, North and South Lanarkshire and East and West Dunbartonshire - are involved.
The City Deal scheme will see Westminster and Holyrood give £500m each in additional grant funding to the eight council areas.
The councils will supplement this by borrowing £130m.
Councillors from across all eight areas will meet to discuss some of the schemes.
Several of the projects being discussed later are in East Renfrewshire, where £44m is expected to be invested over the next few years, with much of the money coming from the City Deal funding.
One is a water sports park at the Dams to Darnley Country Park. It would open in 2017 and include a centre offering wakeboarding, the fastest-growing extreme sport in the world.
A new railway station in Barrhead and sliproad from the M77 would serve an area which could become one of East Renfrewshire's fastest growth areas. The council expects 1,000 new homes to be built there.
Another project would transform the Levern Works site in Barrhead. A site formerly occupied by Nestle, where pet food was once made, would be cleared. The site will then be marketed for development for a range of uses that will bring new jobs to Barrhead.

German authorities have asked the US ambassador for ""swift clarification"".
The US National Security Agency (NSA) was last year accused of bugging the phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel as part of a huge surveillance programme.
The scale of the agency's global spy programme was revealed in documents leaked last year by a former intelligence contractor, Edward Snowden.
The revelations about the NSA put a strain on ties between Germany and the US and raised feeling in Germany against American surveillance.
The BBC's Steve Evans in Berlin says the new allegation of American spying on an ally may make it harder for the US to get German help in its efforts to oppose Russian activity in Ukraine, and also to control Iranian nuclear ambitions.
German media say the man arrested this week is a 31-year-old employee of the federal service, the BND or Bundesnachrichtendienst.
The German federal prosecutor's office confirmed the man's arrest, but gave no other details.
A spokesman for Ms Merkel said she had been informed of the arrest, as had the members of the nine-strong parliamentary committee investigating the activities of foreign intelligence agencies in Germany.
""The matter is serious, it is clear,"" spokesman Steffen Seibert told the Frankfurter Allgemeine newspaper,
Der Spiegel news magazine said the man was believed to have passed secret documents to a US contact in exchange for money.
However, one unnamed politician told Reuters news agency the suspect had offered his services to the US voluntarily.
""This was a man who had no direct contact with the investigative committee... He was not a top agent,""   the source said.

A representative for the theatre then came on stage and said the actress playing Matilda was unable to sing the rest of the songs, so would speak the lyrics instead.
The show's interval was then extended by around 15 minutes.
At the end of the interval, the theatre representative returned and said the actress's voice had deteriorated further and that the performance would be cut short.
The rest of the cast then performed three songs from the second half of the show while a member of the production team narrated the story.
One audience member who was at Wednesday's matinee said the afternoon had left her ""genuinely gutted"".
She continued: ""Â£75 a ticket is not cheap, and not having a healthy understudy for that price is unacceptable.""

""But it was evident from the first song that Matilda wasn't well so it was the right thing to stop the show.

The Royal Shakespeare Company's production is based on Roald Dahl's popular children's novel.
It was adapted for the stage by playwright Dennis Kelly, with music and lyrics by Tim Minchin.
The show became a huge box office success when it opened in London's West End in 2011.
The following year the production won seven Oliviers, a record at the time. It later transferred to Broadway.

39008139,"A 25-year-old woman testified that Larry Nassar molested her from the age of six until 12 during family visits to his Michigan home.
Mr Nassar, 53, is accused by more than 60 former patients and athletes of sexual abuse during pelvic procedures.
He is facing separate federal charges for possession of child pornography.
After testimony at a court in Mason, Michigan, Judge Donald Allen ordered Mr Nassar to stand trial on three counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct with a person under 13 years old.
The accused, a sports doctor who treated US Olympic gymnasts, faces up to life in prison if convicted.
He was stripped of his medical licence last month, amid at least six criminal and civil lawsuits.
The unnamed woman, who was neither a patient nor an athlete, testified against him for more than two hours on Friday.
She detailed how Mr Nassar allegedly molested her during family visits to his home in Holt, Michigan, from 1998 to 2005.
""Almost every time I was there for a couple of years, something occurred,"" she told the court.
Some of the abuse happened under a blanket as he sat next to her on the sofa, while her unwitting older brother sat nearby, she said.
When she tried to tell her parents about the molestation, they did not believe her.
""They made me feel like I had done something terrible,"" she said, adding that they told her to apologise to the doctor. She refused.
When the woman left home for university, she again told her parents about her experience with Mr Nassar.
Her father, who committed suicide in March 2016, ""crumpled"" when she repeated her claims.
Mr Nassar was fired in September after working for decades as a doctor for gymnasts at Michigan State University, as well as USA Gymnastics - the sport's governing body.
Allegations of sexual assault were first revealed by the Indianapolis Star newspaper in September 2016 when he was accused by two former gymnasts.
Since then, more than 60 women have accused him, and at least 40 have filed lawsuits.
Several of those suits name USA Gymnastics as a co-defendent, claiming they had not done enough to prevent the abuse.

Jason Taylor, 21, of Westfield, Lostock Hall denied murder but was found guilty after a trial by jury.
At Preston Court, he was ordered to serve a minimum of 25 years.
Mr Wilson died as a result of catastrophic bleeding from a stab wound in his thigh, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said.
Sophie Lorimer from the CPS North West said the ""brutal attack"" in front of his ex-partner was ""purely motivated by jealousy"".
""He could not accept that the relationship with his ex-girlfriend was over,"" she said.
Taylor's girlfriend said he bombarded her with text messages and phone calls which ""progressively became more and more abusive"".

35773812,"Home Retail Group said that like-for-like sales at Argos fell 1.1% in the eight weeks to 27 February, compared to a fall of 2.2% in the previous quarter.
The electrical and homeware retailer is being targeted by both Sainsbury's and South African retailer Steinhoff.
Both companies have until 18 March to make firm bids for Argos.
Last month, a £1.3bn bid from Sainsbury's for Home Retail was trumped by Steinhoff's £1.4bn offer.
Home Retail recently sold its DIY chain Homebase to Australia's Wesfarmers last month for £340m, leaving Argos as its only remaining business.
Total sales at Argos rose 1.9% to £515m in the eight-week period as demand for furniture and sports goods offset lower sales of electrical goods, such as video games and tablet computers.
The company said Argos opened 90 new stores over the year, bringing the total to 845. The new openings held back the like-for-like sales total over the period, it added.
Chief executive John Walden, who said it had been ""another rather eventful period"" for the company, was pleased with the improvement in Argos' sales.
Shares in Home Retail closed down almost 0.5% at 179.1p, but have risen more than 80% this year following Sainsbury's interest in Argos.
The supermarket has argued that combining both chains would create a ""world-leading"" retailer bigger than rivals John Lewis and Amazon UK.
Retail analyst Nick Bubb said: ""Home Retail claim that underlying like-for-like sales were broadly flat, once the cannibalisation from the infamous concession inserts in Homebase and Sainsbury are taken out. Gross margins were up, however, by 75 basis points and Home Retail's year-end net cash was strong.""
Sainsbury's had offered about 167p a share for Home Retail, but will be forced to at least match the 175p-a-share all-cash offer from Steinhoff, which owns UK furniture retailer Harveys.
However, the supermarket may be reluctant to increase its offer to the level needed to win control of Argos.
Analysts have also questioned the wisdom of Sainsbury's acquiring the struggling retailer.","Argos, the retail chain at the centre of a bidding war, has shown a fall in sales over the Christmas period.","Argos, the retail chain at the centre of a bidding war, has shown a fall in sales over the Christmas period.",0,bart-base,xsum,1

Ms Ruggles, who grew up in Leicestershire and stayed in Newcastle after studying at Northumbria University, made a police statement on 2 October in which she said he sounded ""crazy"" on voicemails, and described him as obsessed.
She said: ""I am terrified of his actions. I am being stalked and I want it to stop.""
She said it was affecting her concentration and work, adding: ""I don't feel safe in my own home.""

34923701,"The Nottingham Pram Company made pushchairs and perambulators from a factory in the city.
All the items, including a Victorian pram made between 1880 and 1885, belonged to John Whitby, who ran the firm for 55 years.
The 15 lots sold for £6,700, exceeding the expected £2,500 price tag.
Auctioneers said the collection was ""a snapshot of a much-loved company"" and was bought by various private collectors across the UK.
The family business was founded in the mid-19th Century by Mr Whitby's grandfather.
More on this story and other news from Nottinghamshire
He took over in 1946, opening a shop on Goose Gate that sold the company's prams, which were manufactured on Alfreton Road, as well as treats for children, such as toys and comics.
Auctioneer Nigel Kirk, of Mellors and Kirk, said the Victorians were ""very keen on prams"".
""Mr Whitby's father, a builder, and his grandfather were clearly men of considerable importance in Victorian and Edwardian Nottingham, of which they were both appointed freemen,"" he said.
""When he retired [in 2001], John Whitby had the foresight to carefully preserve everything connected with his grandfather's enterprise.
""For half a century the company was something of a Nottingham institution, selling not just prams but everything for the young child.""
The Victorian pram, which beat its estimate and sold for £590, has a ""coach-built body"" similar to the style used by the Royal Family to transport Princess Charlotte to her christening.

All the items, including a Victorian pram made between 1880 and 1885, belonged to John Whitby, who ran the firm for 55 years.
The 15 lots sold for £6,700, exceeding the expected £2,500 price tag.
Auctioneers said the collection was ""a snapshot of a much-loved company"" and was bought by various private collectors across the UK.
The family business was founded in the mid-19th Century by Mr Whitby's grandfather.

He took over in 1946, opening a shop on Goose Gate that sold the company's prams, which were manufactured on Alfreton Road, as well as treats for children, such as toys and comics.
Auctioneer Nigel Kirk, of Mellors and Kirk, said the Victorians were ""very keen on prams"".
""Mr Whitby's father, a builder, and his grandfather were clearly men of considerable importance in Victorian and Edwardian Nottingham, of which they were both appointed freemen,"" he said.
""When he retired [in 2001], John Whitby had the foresight to carefully preserve everything connected with his grandfather's enterprise.
""For half a century the company was something of a Nottingham institution, selling not just prams but everything for the young child.""
The Victorian pram, which beat its estimate and sold for £590, has a ""coach-built body"" similar to the style used by the Royal Family to transport Princess Charlotte to her christening.
A painted wooden sign, which once hung outside the shop, was also auctioned, as well as catalogues, photographs, toys, comics, shop display material and World War Two posters and souvenirs.

38585562,"Motorcyclist Leighton Santos, 22, admitted causing David Hitchen's death through careless driving and was jailed at Preston Crown Court on Monday.
The maximum sentence is five years, but this can be reduced by a guilty plea.
Road safety charity Brake said there was a ""need to see much tougher sentences when a driver has killed"".
Santos admitted causing the 42-year-old former Great Britain international's death near Belmont, Lancashire, in September 2014, on the first day of his trial.
Lancashire Police said Santos had been riding a Yamaha motorbike on Rivington Road when he ""drifted into the opposite carriageway"" and collided with Mr Hitchen.
The cyclist suffered serious injuries and died later in hospital.
In addition to the six months for causing death by careless driving, Santos was also given 12 months for another motoring offence.
In March 2016 he was convicted at Manchester Crown Court of dangerous driving after taking police on an eight-mile pursuit that saw him reach speeds of up to 90mph (145km/h) in a 30mph zone.
Martin Key, British Cycling's campaigns manager, said six months for ""causing the death of a human being is a punishment that many would agree certainly does not fit the crime"".
""While these incidents are extremely rare, we need to ensure that sentencing guidelines adequately reflect the potential consequences of an offence,"" he said.
A spokeswoman for Brake said the sentence was ""insulting"".
""Leighton Santos, who killed another human being, was sentenced to a paltry 18 months in prison, and will likely be out in nine.
""It's no wonder that grieving relatives are often left feeling let down and insulted by our justice system.

11154244,"Researchers found that four out of five children in England who ate school lunches had tried food at school that they had not tried at home.
Half of parents questioned said their children had asked for foods they had eaten at school to be cooked at home.
The survey, of about 1,000 parents, found the most popular vegetables were carrots, sweetcorn and peas.
Aubergine, chickpeas and spinach were among the least popular.
Of the parents questioned, 628 had children who ate school lunches.
(% denotes proportion of parents who said their child would eat each vegetable)
England's School Food Trust commissioned the research after a survey by the Mumsnet website suggested some parents gave their children packed lunches because they thought they were too fussy to eat anything else.
Trust chairman, Rob Rees, said: ""Every parent knows it's a nightmare watching their child push food around the plate.
""School meals can be a great way to help parents encourage their children to try new foods and to increase the variety of foods in their diet.""
Mumsnet co-founder, Carrie Longton, said: ""Getting children to eat healthily is every parent's dream, but meal times at home can often be a battle ground and emotionally charged.
""From Mumsnetters' experience it seems that once at school there's a desire to fit in with everyone else and even some positive peer pressure to boast about the variety of what foods you can eat.
""School meals have also moved on quite a bit from when Mumsnetters were at school, with healthier options and more variety.""
School meals in England now have to comply with strict nutritional guidelines.
About four in 10 primary school children in England now eat school lunches, slightly more than in secondary schools.

33811105,"A review for the Commission on Local Tax Reform said there was no ""magic bullet"" to cure defects in the system.
It said the council tax had built-in problems ""from day one"" but a failure to modify it had stored up more difficulties for policy makers.
The commission, set up by the Scottish government and council body Cosla, will report back later this year.
Prof Kenneth Gibb, from the University of Glasgow, was asked to review different systems of local taxation across the world.
He found that a tax on property was used by almost all OECD countries and was seen by academics as a ""good tax"" because it was stable, difficult to avoid and could have a desirable impact on housing markets.
But it also generated confusion with taxpayers unclear whether it was a tax on wealth or a charge for services such as refuse collection.
Some felt it was unfair because it was not linked to current income.
Prof Gibb noted that a local income tax, used by many countries, was generally perceived as fairer.
But he found such a system created difficulties for local authorities because it meant their income fluctuated. There was also little opportunity to vary tax rates to reflect local priorities.
He said:  ""It is clear there is no magic bullet.
""Past experience from the UK and across the world shows that reform is always going to be difficult and will inevitably be bound up with the previous experiences and traumas of past reform.
""So whilst the current council tax has many deficiencies, change and reform is a major undertaking.""
The commission now intends to hold a public consultation across Scotland before publishing its report in the autumn.
A Scottish government spokesman said ministers consider the current council tax system ""as a whole to be unfair"".

As of 31 March 2016, only one case of homicide recorded in 2015-16 was unresolved.

Campaigners had feared the scheme would reduce the waterfall to a ""trickle"".
Natural Resources Wales refused permission saying it could harm the local environment.
RWE Innogy UK had said its Conwy Falls hydro power station plans, in Conwy Valley, could provide more than 3,200 households with power.
The plans, which had faced opposition from environmentalists, anglers, canoeists and businesses, would have seen a new hydro power scheme built 400 metres (1,312ft) upstream from the falls.
But on Thursday, NRW turned down the application for a permit to build and operate the plant saying the company wanted to abstract too much water at times from the river.
Sian Williams, head of operations north for NRW, said: ""The Conwy is an important natural asset for the area and we've conducted a detailed assessment of the proposals before reaching this decision.
""We support sustainable developments in the right places.

38414906,"RWE Innogy UK had applied for a permit to divert water from the River Conwy to supply a new hydroelectric scheme near Betws-y-Coed.
Campaigners had feared the scheme would reduce the waterfall to a ""trickle"".
Natural Resources Wales refused permission saying it could harm the local environment.
RWE Innogy UK had said its Conwy Falls hydro power station plans, in Conwy Valley, could provide more than 3,200 households with power.
The plans, which had faced opposition from environmentalists, anglers, canoeists and businesses, would have seen a new hydro power scheme built 400 metres (1,312ft) upstream from the falls.
But on Thursday, NRW turned down the application for a permit to build and operate the plant saying the company wanted to abstract too much water at times from the river.
Sian Williams, head of operations north for NRW, said: ""The Conwy is an important natural asset for the area and we've conducted a detailed assessment of the proposals before reaching this decision.
""We support sustainable developments in the right places.
""But the evidence we've scrutinised shows that the proposal submitted could harm the local environment. As such, we can't grant it a permit.""

A 38-year-old man has been arrested.
Officials say the man had confessed to belonging to a local criminal gang. Police are searching for another three men believed to have been involved in the kidnapping.
State prosecutor Ismael Quintanilla said the masked gang had taken Pulido to a house in Ciudad Victoria where he eventually found himself alone with one of his abductors.

Eventually, they believe using AI could revolutionise healthcare by turning anyone's smartphone into a cancer scanner.
Cancer Research UK said it could become a useful tool for doctors.
The AI was repurposed from software developed by Google that had learned to spot the difference between images of cats and dogs.
It was shown 129,450 photographs and told what type of skin condition it was looking at in each one.
It then learned to spot the hallmarks of the most common type of skin cancer: carcinoma, and the most deadly: melanoma.
Only one in 20 skin cancers are melanoma, yet the tumour accounts for three-quarters of skin cancer deaths.
The experiment, detailed in the journal Nature, then tested the AI against 21 trained skin cancer doctors.
One of the researchers, Dr Andre Esteva, told the BBC News website: ""We find, in general, that we are on par with board-certified dermatologists.""
However, the computer software cannot make a full diagnosis, as this is normally confirmed with a tissue biopsy.
Dr Esteva said the system now needed to be tested alongside doctors in the clinic.
""The application of AI to healthcare is, we believe, an incredibly exciting area of research that can be leveraged to achieve a great deal of societal good,"" he said.
""One particular route that we find exciting is the use of this algorithm on a mobile device, but to achieve this we would have to build an app and test its accuracy directly from a mobile device.""
Incredible advances in machine-learning have already led to AI beating one of humanity's best Go players.
And a team of doctors in London have trained AI to predict when the heart will fail.
Dr Jana Witt, from the charity Cancer Research UK, said:  ""Using artificial intelligence to help diagnose skin cancer is very interesting, as it could support assessments by GPs and dermatologists.
""It's unlikely that AI will replace all of the other information your clinician would consider when making a diagnosis, but AI could help guide GP referrals to specialists in the future.""

Dr Jana Witt, from the charity Cancer Research UK, said:  ""Using artificial intelligence to help diagnose skin cancer is very interesting, as it could support assessments by GPs and dermatologists.
""It's unlikely that AI will replace all of the other information your clinician would consider when making a diagnosis, but AI could help guide GP referrals to specialists in the future.""

They were arrested in October 2013, but despite the charges being quashed, a police appeal has blocked their return.
Their case was due to be heard later, but has now been adjourned to 22 April.

Mr Dunn, who is living in a hostel on the outskirts of Chennai, formally Madras, had said he was ""anxious"" ahead of the court hearing, which would have been presided over by a judge.
The 28-year-old, from Ashington, said he hoped ""that we get the decision we so justly deserve"".
Mr Dunn is staying with two Estonians who were also part of the crew of the private US-owned ship MV Seaman Guard Ohio.
Andrew Linnington, of the maritime union Nautilus International, which has been lobbying the UK government on behalf of the crew members, said he feared the six men were being made examples of.
He said: ""The Indian authorities want to set a deterrent to operators of similar vessels to the one these six men were working on. Just about every element of this case has been disputed.""
A UK Foreign Office spokesman said: ""We appreciate that this continues to be a very difficult time for these men and their families and we are committed to keeping them up to date on the latest developments.""

32116166,"The statue at the University of Cape Town had been attacked as a surviving symbol of white minority rule.
The university's vice-chancellor has backed calls to move the statue and says a final decision will be brought forward to a special meeting next week.
Student leaders have hailed a ""victory"" for their Rhodes Must Fall campaign.
Vice-chancellor Max Price has said the university's senate accepted calls for the statue to be permanently removed from the campus and that it should be boarded up until a final decision was reached.
With more than 180 votes in the senate, only one voted against the statue's removal and there were three abstentions.
A meeting of the university's council to decide the statue's fate is being brought forward to next week, said a statement from Dr Price - and there will need to be consultations with local heritage authorities.
The statue of Cecil Rhodes has become part of a symbolic struggle at the University of Cape Town, one of the the highest ranking universities in Africa in international league tables.
Rhodes, a British politician and business magnate who died in 1902, was a powerful figure in colonial South Africa, and his statue has remained on the campus of this high-profile university.
But earlier this month, the statue was attacked by a protester who tipped a bucket of human excrement over the figure of Rhodes.
It began several weeks of protest by students who saw the statue as representing the lack of opportunities still facing the black majority two decades after the end of apartheid.
It sparked arguments about how modern South Africa should represent the legacy of its colonial and apartheid-era past.
There have also been debates about access for black students to top universities.
The statue had been wrapped in black plastic to protect it, but it has now been entirely boarded up.

22355021,"Shopkeeper Alice Wheeldon was found guilty of a poison plot against David Lloyd George in 1917.
Since her death in 1919, a campaign has emerged to clear her name.
Her former home at 12 Pear Tree Road, Normanton, is being marked with a plaque in a ceremony organised by Derby Civic Society and the city council.
Keith Venables, from the Derby People's History group, which campaigned for justice for the family, said: ""It's wonderful to celebrate the contribution of Alice Wheeldon and her family. Their name was vilified.""
Mrs Wheeldon, a mother of four, supported the suffragette movement and was a conscientious objector to World War I.
Mr Venables believes she was framed by the authorities who were anxious about opposition to the war.
The radical women who fought for the vote
The family claimed an MI5 agent, posing as an objector, embroiled Mrs Wheeldon in a plot to poison dogs guarding prisoners against the war.
However, the family were accused of plotting to murder the prime minister by shooting him with poisoned darts.
On 31 January 1917, Mrs Wheeldon, her daughters Hetty and Winnie and son-in-law Alfred Mason were arrested and charged.
Mrs Wheeldon was sentenced to 10 years, Alfred seven years and Winnie five years. Hetty was acquitted.
Mrs Wheeldon went on a hunger strike and was released after nine months but died shortly afterwards.
Historian Dr Nicholas Hiley, who researched the family's story, said: ""The whole thing was a travesty.
""The truth about Alice Wheeldon deserves to be publicised and the blue plaque is the beginning of that. The Wheeldons should be honoured and remembered for the stand they took during the war.""
Mrs Wheeldon's descendents moved to Australia, but her great-granddaughters, Deirdre and Chloe Mason, are visiting Derby for the ceremony.

21712349,"It works by looking for a combination of ""markers"" in the blood which are different in healthy people and those with the disease.
Delegates at the Alzheimer's Research UK Conference heard that the University of Nottingham is now developing a quick and easy test to do in clinics.
It could mean much earlier diagnosis and better treatments, they said.
The test uses some proteins that have been strongly linked with Alzheimer's disease, such as amyloid and APOE.
But through careful analysis of blood from people with the disease, as well as those with early-stage memory problems, the researchers detected some other markers that were suggestive of the disease.
Most notably, some proteins related to inflammation seem to have been added to increase the power of the test.
Prof Kevin Morgan from the University of Nottingham said they still had to validate the test and it could be a decade before it was used in patients.
But he added that the combination of markers they had found was looking very promising.
""Our findings are exciting because they show that it is technically possible to distinguish between healthy people and those with Alzheimer's using a blood test.
""As blood tests are a fast and easy way of aiding diagnosis, we are really encouraged by these findings and the potential they hold for the future.""
He said there were several ways the test could benefit patients, including giving people a definitive diagnosis, which was not always possible at the moment.
It could also direct future therapies to make sure patients were getting the most appropriate treatment, he explained.
Potentially, it could be a ""cheap and easy pre-screen"" test which enabled Alzheimer's to be picked up before symptoms appeared, he said.
""The way we see it working is you can test people and it will tell them if they have the all-clear, or if they are medium- or high-risk.
""If they are medium-risk, they can be monitored closely and high-risk patients can be referred to a specialist for more in-depth testing.""
Dr Eric Karran, director of Research at Alzheimer's Research UK, said: ""Giving people with dementia an accurate diagnosis is not always easy, and so building up our armoury of diagnostic techniques is vital.

UKTV said the programme was broadcast in error and was unsuitable for a pre-watershed transmission.
In the 14-minute segment, Brown had sought to demonstrate a technique to limit pain and bleeding.   He placed a transparent bag over his head and sealed it while a member of the audience tapped out his pulse rate on a drum.
Once his pulse rate had slowed to a stop, Brown - who appeared to be in a state of semi-consciousness - removed the bag from his head and walked barefoot on a path of broken glass.

Experts said the lack of key digital skills was a primary barrier to doing more business online, with 15% of firms across the UK stating this was the main barrier, more than doubling since 2015.

Expectations were for a fall in revenues of just over 31%.
Macau is the world's largest gaming centre - ahead of Las Vegas - and the only place in China where casinos are allowed.
A special administrative region of China, Macau's economy relies heavily on gambling and shopping - especially by big spending tourists from the mainland.
But Chinese President Xi Jinping's campaign against corruption and luxury spending, which began in December 2012, has seen officials and others from the mainland more wary of gaming and spending in the city.
China's Communist Party prohibits officials from gambling, but until the 2012 crackdown, officials had reportedly visited Macau's casinos to gamble and spend.
China has emphasised Macau's need to diversify its economy away from gambling. The city's build up of new resorts and hotels is expected to help drive general tourism, however, analysts have said Macau will be hard-pressed to build up non-gaming streams of revenue in the near future.
Official numbers released on Monday showed the city's economy shrank by 24.2% year-on-year during three months to September, the city's Statistics and Census Service said.
""Economic contraction in the third quarter was attributable to the continuous decline in exports of services, of which exports of gaming services decreased by 37.4% year-on-year and exports of other tourism services dropped by 15.3%,"" it added.
Once a Portuguese colony, gaming has taken place in Macau for more than 300 years. For many years it was referred to as the Monte Carlo of the Orient. The city was returned to Chinese rule in 1999.",Revenue in Macau fell by more than a third as China's corruption crackdown continued to drive away some tourists.,"gamblers can now bet in Macau, but not in China.

Expectations were for a fall in revenues of just over 31%.
Macau is the world's largest gaming centre - ahead of Las Vegas - and the only place in China where casinos are allowed.
A special administrative region of China, Macau's economy relies heavily on gambling and shopping - especially by big spending tourists from the mainland.

23501020,"In the last three weeks, blooms have appeared along the shoreline on Anglesey and there have been some reports of children being stung.
The cold spring meant there were few reports of jellyfish before June.
Frankie Hobrow from the Anglesey Sea Zoo advised swimmers to ""look but don't touch"" and to treat stings with vinegar.
The Marine Conservation Society (MCS) said jellyfish, including the Lion's Mane variety, have been seen by holidaymakers at Benllech beach, on the Menai Strait.
Ms Hobrow said: ""They have increased over the last two or three weeks with the warmer weather. They get carried around on the ocean currents, they can't swim very well so they rely on being carried around, and we do see this every year once it gets warmer.
""The sea temperatures warm up slightly and we get a lot more swarms of jellyfish.""
Ms Hobrow said the Lion's Mane gives a ""nasty sting"".
She said: ""They can grow very, very big - over two metres - but the ones here are fairly small.
""They can be painful but it's generally localised pain - it doesn't usually last very long. You can often help if you apply vinegar - that's great because it's acidic.""
She also said urine could also be used because of its acidity.
The MCS's National Jellyfish Survey, which is in its 10th year, said 7,500 jellyfish reports have been made by the public over the last decade.
Dr Peter Richardson, the charity's biodiversity programme manager, said: ""The scarcity of jellyfish reports before June was unusual and could well be linked to the exceptionally cold spring.
""However, as our waters warmed, sightings of jellyfish increased, with moon jellyfish reported in large numbers around the UK, reports of compass and blue jellyfish in the south west, and blooms of Lion's Mane jellies around north Wales and north west England.""","The jellyfish population has soared after the recent warm weather, experts have said.","He said the cold spring had been a ""very good time"" for jellyfish to spawn, but added: ""They are not as good as they used to be, so we...

Two women who wear full veils launched an immediate court challenge, saying the law is discriminatory.

Other MPs said that full face veils such as the burka or the niqab were a symbol of the oppression of women.
But critics of the law say it could end up excluding women, leaving those who do wear the full veil trapped in their homes.
And they say the measures are over the top - estimates suggest only a few dozen women wear this kind of veil in Belgium, out of a Muslim population of about half a million.

Beijing saw its second red alert over the weekend. The latest wave of alerts includes the industrial port Tianjin.
Red alerts trigger advisories for people to stay inside, schools to stop classes, and restrict vehicle use.
An environmental ministry statement issued on  Wednesday night said the 10 cities with red alerts include Tianjin as well as smaller surrounding cities Puyang, Xinxiang, Dezhou, Handan, Xintai, Langfang, Hengshui, Xinji and Anyang.
They are among 30 cities including Beijing seeing ""severe pollution"". Another 20 cities have ""heavy pollution"".
The latest news was met with resignation, and even some jokes, by Chinese netizens who have endured bad air quality levels in recent weeks.
On Wednesday, images of  a purple-tinged sunset in Nanjing spread across social media with many users attributing it to the pollution in the city.
""New type of haze: grape flavoured,"" joked Weibo user Chenyingshisupoman.
Another Weibo user Diliutianmaoxianjia said sarcastically: ""Compared to the heavy smog of Beijing, the strong smog of Hebei, and damp heat of Shanghai, I prefer the colours of Nanjing's smog... it is durable and refreshing... once you breathe it in it sticks to your heart.""
Beijing's second red alert ended on Tuesday night. The ministry said the capital's air quality was ""slowly improving"".
But some parts of neighbouring Henan and Hebei regions were still seeing heavy pollution, with levels of the PM2.5 pollutant surpassing 300 mg per cubic metre - the hazardous level in China.
China has seen extremely high levels of air pollution in recent years, particularly in the coal-reliant north east, the industrial heart of the country.

Kevin McKee and Seamus Wright were both IRA members who were abducted and murdered by the organisation in 1972.
Their bodies were found unexpectedly during a search for another of the Disappeared, Joe Lynskey.

They say the tiles date from the period of the Second Temple, during the time of King Herod about 2,000 years ago.
The temple was destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD during a Jewish rebellion.
Some 600 segments of coloured stone floor have been found since archaeologists began examining the debris from the hilltop site in 2004.
The plateau where the temples stood is the most sacred site in Judaism. It is joined by the Western Wall, venerated by Jews as part of the original supporting wall of the temple compound.
Haram al-Sharif (Noble Sanctuary) is also the place where Muslims believe the Prophet Muhammad ascended to Heaven, and is the third holiest site in Islam.
The archaeologists say the tiles probably came from porticos in the temple's courtyards.
Piecing the fragments together ""enables us to get an idea of the Temple's incredible splendour"", said Dr Gabriel Barkay of the Temple Mount Sifting Project.
Experts say they managed to assemble seven potential designs of how the flooring could have looked like.

In a statement, McDonald's said: ""We are proud of our franchisees and are committed to working closely together so that they have the support they need to operate their restaurants and their businesses.
""This approach, with the principle of sharing risk and reward, has been successful for many years and has helped create the best business opportunities for our franchisees and the best overall experience for our customers.""
The Service Employees International Union (SEIU) and European unions, including the Bakers Food and Allied Workers Union in the UK, are supporting the formal antitrust complaint.
""McDonald's abuse of its dominant market position hurts everyone: franchisees, consumers, and workers. We strongly urge the European Commission to investigate the charges and to use all of its powers to hold McDonald's accountable,"" said SEIU organising director, Scott Courtney.
The European Commission said it would now study the submission. It has the powers to launch an investigation if it believes the allegations are founded.
The consumer organisations claim franchisees are prevented from switching to competitors because McDonald's makes them sign longer-than-average contracts.
They also said licensees lease premises from the company at above market rates.
It is claimed this leads to poorer consumer choice and higher prices in franchise stores as opposed to those owned directly by the company.
Franchisees own and operate 73% of McDonald's restaurants in Europe.
